00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:51,058
and find your family.
All you have to do is give me the tag.

455
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,269
What tag?
(GASPS) There's a tag on my fin!

456
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:55,855
How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

457
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,901
Oh no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

458
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,319
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

459
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,114
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

460
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,076
Um, you were about to give me your tag.

461
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:10,369
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

462
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:11,412
So I can go to...

463
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,539
So I can go to Cleveland.

464
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:15,791
Cleveland? Mmm.
I hear good things

465
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,042
about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go?

466
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,378
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

467
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,713
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

I just want to live in a glass box alone.

470
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,262
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

471
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:29,763
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:43,111
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

476
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,487
(GASPS) A map! Good idea.

477
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:47,699
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh boy.

478
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:52,327
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...

479
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:56,082
I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?

480
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,584
Great idea.

sure that's what I said?

00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,830
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

484
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:10,999
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

485
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,959
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

486
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,335
and she got taken by some...

487
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:15,627
All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

488
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:19,007
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...

489
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:23,010
I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...

490
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,181
I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."

491
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:29,349
So I... Oh, it's my fault!

492
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:33,354
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

493
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,147
What if it's a restaurant?

Your friend is okay.

- She is?
- It's a fish hospital.

Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

it's not destiny.

Hey, my home had a purple shell.

So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

Purple shells were her favourite

All right, I'll go with you.

- Is that blue blob talking?

- Can you help me? I lost my family.
- You lost your family?

Well, it's a long story,

- Dory, it's me! Destiny!
- You know me?

639
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:57,122
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

640
00:31:57,288 --> 00:31:58,914
- We were pipe pals!
- We were?

641

- So you know where I'm from?

Yep, you are from

I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?

(GASPS) Then that's
where my parents are.

00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,384
We got to go. Can you take me there?

646
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,220
Uh... Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

(WHISPERING)
That's my neighbour, Bailey.

650
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,310
He was brought in with a head injury.

651
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:20,561
I know you're talking about me, Destiny.

652
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:22,855
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

653
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:25,066
the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

654
00:32:25,232 --> 00:32:27,152
Hear every word
you're saying about me.

655
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:28,319
What's echolocation?

656
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:31,405
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

657
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:36,619
find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

658
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:38,579
Now I know you're talking about me.

659
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,499
- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.

660
00:32:40,664 --> 00:32:42,375
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

661
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,586
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

662
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:48,048
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

663
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:49,965
Echolocation.

664
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,594
Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

665
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:53,845
- What?
- What are glasses?

666
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,763
It's sort of like you go, "hoo"

667
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:58,642
and then you see things.
Why do I know that?

668
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,185
Oh. That's interesting.

669
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:06,566
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

670
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:09,236
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

- HANK: Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?

679
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,757
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

680

Did you get that, Hank? All that?

681
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,055
- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.

682
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:40,642
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:42,309
Um...

684
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:49,442

I'm not so good with directions.

685
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,653
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

686
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,780
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

687
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:57,784
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

- But I can't get in that way.

easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

too hard, you should just give up.

it's the building over there.

- Do you know how we found you?

1209
00:59:16,884 --> 00:59:18,719
- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.

1210

- No, an oyster.
- No.

- No clam.

We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

1215

"What would Dory do?"

1216
00:59:28,813 --> 00:59:30,063
Why would you say that?

1217
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,233
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,612
stuff I never dreamed of doing.

Outsmarting sharks
and jumping jellyfish.

1220
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,414
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

1221
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:53,463
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

1222
00:59:54,713 --> 00:59:57,925
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

1223
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,927
And I'm sorry about that.

But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

01:00:11,063 --> 01:00:16,610
And when you do that, you'll be home.

1361
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:15,639
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

1362
01:09:15,805 --> 01:09:20,853
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

1363
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,689
- (SNIFFLES) What?
- You found us!

1364
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,609
That's right. You found us.

1365
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:31,572
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

1366
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:35,576
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

1367
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:36,868
Exactly!

1368
01:09:37,578 --> 01:09:40,538
But I thought you were gone.
How did you...

1369
01:09:40,622 --> 01:09:43,667
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

1370
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:46,837
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1371
01:09:47,003 --> 01:09:49,215
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

1372
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:53,219
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

1373
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:55,720
- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.

1374
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,890
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1375
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,935
Shells.

1376
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:11,237
And you found us.
Oh honey, you found us.

1377
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:13,905
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

1378
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:20,371
You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.

Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

Oh, my poor little girl.

of eyeballs doing nothing.

Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

01:10:52,735 --> 01:10:57,198
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?

01:10:57,323 --> 01:10:58,742
Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?

1392

(GASPS) I'm sorry.

1393
01:11:00,994 --> 01:11:03,956
I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

there to see that.

I even know how to speak whale...

but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

You know, I like this Marlin already.

1402
01:11:18,136 --> 01:11:20,597
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

1403
01:11:20,764 --> 01:11:23,182
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1404
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,060
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

Um, what would Dory do?

That means I could...
Never see them again!

No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?

1418

Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.
