<i>Freight car</i>

11
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,418
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,221
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,968
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,468
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,676
No witnesses.

16
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,663
Well done Soldier.

17
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,621
<i>All right, what do you see?</i>

18
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,187
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,496
Small station.

20
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,796
<i>Quiet street.
It's a good target.</i>

21
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,449
There's an ATM on the south corner, which means?
Cameras.

22
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,454
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.</i>

23
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,896
Means our guy doesn't care about being seen.
He isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out.

24
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:49,899
You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

25
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,322
<i>It's also bulletproof,
which means private security.....</i>

26
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:56,449
<i>...which means more guns which means
more headaches for somebody. Probably us.</i>

27
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,250
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?

28
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,352
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

29
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:07,331
Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?

30
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,699
<i>Eyes on target, folks.</i>

31
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,990
This is the best lead we have had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.

32
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,112
If he sees us coming, that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.

33
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,257
Sam...

34
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:21,848
....see that garbage truck?

35
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,223
Tag it.

36
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,473
<i>Give me X-ray.</i>

37
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:52,399
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed. It's a battering ram.

38
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,810
<i>- Go now.
- What?</i>

39
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,889
He's not hitting the police.

40
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,985
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.

41
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,670
I make five.

42
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,668
Sam.....

43
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:24,798
Four.

44
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,399
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.

45
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,817
What about the gas?
Get it out.

46
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,836
<i>Pack it up.</i>

47
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,514
<i>He's here.</i>

48
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,882
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I am on it.

49
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,408
I don't work like that no more.

50
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:20,582
<i>Fire in the hole.</i>

51
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,629
<i>No.....</i>

52
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,952
<i>Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.</i>

53
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:02,289
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not going to outrun them. Lose the truck.

54
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,967
Where are you going to meet us?
I am not.

55
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,321
I have got four, they're splitting up.

56
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,494
I got the two on the left.

57
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,874
They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

58
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,386
There you are, you son of a bitch.

59
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,994
I have been waiting for this.

60
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,331
<i>He doesn't have it.</i>

61
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:15,347
<i>I am empty!
Out of the way!</i>

62
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,565
Drop it.

63
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,648
Or I will drop this.

64
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,143
- Drop it!
- He will do it!

65
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:12,899
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam. Don't thank me.
I am not thanking that thing.

66
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,102
His name is Redwing. I am still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

67
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,667
Come on!

68
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:35,264
This is for dropping a building on my face.

69
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,378
Ahh.....

70
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:02,000
I think I look pretty good, all things considered.
Who's your buyer? You know, he knew you.

71
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,578
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.

72
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,645
What did you say?
He remembered you.

73
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,086
I was there. He got all weepy about it.

74
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,491
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

75
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,278
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me.....

76
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,572
"Please tell Rogers.

77
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,461
"When you got to go, you got to go."

78
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,618
And you're coming with me.

79
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,568
Oh, my.....

80
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,600
Sam, we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.

81
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,575
We got to get up there.

82
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:16,350
<i># Try to remember the kind of September #
# When grass was green #</i>

83
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,735
Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?

84
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,972
This is why I love coming home for
Christmas right before you leave town.

85
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:31,994
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name? Candice.

86
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:36,350
Do me a favour? Try not to burn the house
down before Monday. Okay, so it's Monday.

87
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,071
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

88
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:44,200
Where you going? Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

89
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,995
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?

90
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't worry, you're going to love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

91
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,085
You know, they say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

92
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:57,909
If that's true, you will be a great man someday.
I will get the bags.

93
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,634
He does miss you when you're not here.

94
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,433
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

95
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,524
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.

96
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,806
You know what's about to happen.

97
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,236
Say something.
If you don't, you will regret it.

98
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,113
I love you, Dad.

99
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,542
And I know you did the best you could.

100
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,543
That's how I wish it happened.

101
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:53,549
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing or BARF.
God, I got to work on that acronym.

102
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:58,320
An extremely costly method of hijacking
the hippocampus......

103
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,187
.....to clear traumatic memories.

104
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:09,860
Huh. It doesn't change the fact
that they never made it to the airport...

105
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,409
...or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...

106
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:19,995
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

107
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,615
No one in their right mind
would have ever funded it.

108
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,149
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?

109
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,548
"To generate, disseminate
and preserve knowledge."

110
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,684
"And work with others....

111
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,914
"...to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

112
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:41,881
Well, you are the others.

113
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,620
And, quiet as it's kept the challenges facing
you are the greatest mankind's ever known.

114
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,119
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I am sorry. Rather, you were.

115
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,537
As of this moment...

116
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:59,100
...every student has been made an equal recipient
of the inaugural September Foundation Grant.

117
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,957
As in all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

118
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:11,740
No strings, no taxes,
just reframe the future!

119
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,664
Starting now.

120
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,297
Go break some eggs.

121
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,985
- Wow....
- Wow...

122
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:41,600
That took my breath away. Oh, Tony!
So generous. So much money! Wow!

123
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Out of curiosity, will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

124
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,950
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.

125
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,279
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

126
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,047
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah? Yeah.

127
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:56,149
Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter.

128
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,299
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it. It's....

129
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,843
....fine. I will be right back.
We will catch up later.

130
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:25,799
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

131
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,367
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

132
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,441
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

133
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:39,212
But if you have got the money.....

134
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:42,204
....break as many eggs as you like.

135
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,242
<i>Right?</i>

136
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,998
Are you going up?

137
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:56,397
I am right where I want to be.

138
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,878
Okay. Okay.
Hey.

139
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,384
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.

140
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,440
Human Resources.

141
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,788
I know it's boring....

142
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:14,483
....but it enabled me to raise a son.

143
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,632
I am very proud of what he grew up to be.

144
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,522
His name was Charlie Spencer.

145
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,817
You murdered him.

146
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,480
In Sokovia.

147
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,407
Not that that matters in the least to you.

148
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,413
You think you fight for us?

149
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,568
You just fight for yourself.

150
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,740
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

151
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,407
He's dead.....

152
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:51,752
...and I blame you.

153
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,401
<i>11 Wakandans were among those killed
during a confrontation...</i>

154
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:07,836
<i>between the Avengers and a group
of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria last month.</i>

155
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:10,875

<i>...in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil...</i>

157
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,906
<i>not only because of the actions of criminals...</i>

158
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:23,906
<i>but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.</i>

159
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:29,550
<i>Victory at the expense of the innocent
is no victory at all.</i>

160
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,714
<i>The Wakandan king went on to... They are operating
outside and above the international law.</i>

161
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:37,799
<i>Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.</i>

162
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,694
<i>What legal authority does an enhanced individual
like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri...?</i>

163
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,337
It's my fault.

164
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,999
That's not true. Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.

165
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,361
I should have clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

166
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,255
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

167
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,818
and all of a sudden I was
a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn.

168
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,455
And people died.

169
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,268
It's on me.
It's on both of us.

170
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,388
This job...

171
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,994
We try to save as many people as we can.

172
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,993
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.

173
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:33,445
But if we can't find a way to live with that
then next time... maybe nobody gets saved.

174
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:42,699
Vis! We talked about this. Yes,
but the door was open so I assumed that...

175
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,079
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

176
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,652
Thank you. We will be right down.
I will use the door.

177
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:56,599
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?

178
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,872
The Secretary of State.

179
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,575
<i>Five years ago...</i>

180
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,430
....I had a heart attack.....

181
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,273
....and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

182
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:16,548
Turned out it was the best round of my life because
after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass...

183
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:21,318
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.

184
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,201
<i>"Perspective."</i>

185
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,089
The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt.

186
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:40,326
You've fought for us, protected us, risked your lives
but while a great many people see you as heroes....

187
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,517
...there are some...

188
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:48,391
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
And what word would you use, Mr Secretary?

189
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,080
How about "dangerous"?

190
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,288
What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced
individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders...

191
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:04,324
...and inflict their will wherever they choose
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned....

192
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,493
....about what they leave behind?

193
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,170
New York.

194
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,020
Washington, D.C.

195
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,717
<i>Sokovia.</i>

196
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,701
<i>Lagos....</i>

197
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,664
Okay.
That's enough.

198
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:06,801
For the past four years, you have operated
with unlimited power and no supervision.

199
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:11,430
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.

200
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,813
But I think we have a solution.

201
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,195
The Sokovia Accords.

202
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:31,294
Approved by 117 countries it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.

203
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,354
Instead...

204
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,650
they will operate under the supervision

205
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:41,990
of a United Nations panel
only when and if that panel deems it necessary.

206
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,599
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

207
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,299
I feel we have done that.

208
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,999
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

209
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:57,890
If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes
you can bet there'd be consequences.

210
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,347
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

211
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:05,859
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

212
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:09,365
So, there are contingencies.

213
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:14,301
Three days from now, the UN meets
in Vienna to ratify the Accords.

214
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,962
Talk it over.

215
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,397
And if we come to a decision you don't like?

216
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,436
Then you retire.

217
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,472
Hello....?

218
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,040
Is this your car out front?

219
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,421
I jumped the kerb.

220
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,240
Maybe we could take care of it ourselves.

221
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,666
If you want to call the cops,
that's okay, too, I guess. No.

222
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,432
No cops.

223
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,576
<i>Thank you.</i>

224
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,628
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

225
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,751
<i>Congratulations.</i>

226
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,770
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?

227
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,819
My name is Zemo.

228
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,192
I will repeat my question.

229
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:16,750
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?

230
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:22,423
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell, Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

231
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:28,644
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher. But.....

232
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:32,261
....I have experience.

233
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,993
And patience.

234
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,997
A man can do anything if he has those.

235
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,997
What do you want?

236
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,700
Mission report.

237
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
December 16.

238
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,549
<i>"1991."</i>

239
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,618
Go..... to..... hell!

240
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,320
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.

241
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,420
But I'd have to use this book and other
bloodier methods to find what I need.

242
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,095
I don't look forward to that.

243
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,188
You'd only be dying for your pride.

244
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,699
<i>Hail "HYDRA".</i>

245
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:57,500
Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal
of Honour which is one more than you have.

246
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,250
So let's say we agree to this thing.

247
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,599
How long is it going to be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?

248
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,750
117 countries want to sign this.

249
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,634
117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool."
We got it. How long are you going to play....

250
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:12,375
...both sides? I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.

251
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,750
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...

252
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:22,209
the number of known enhanced persons has grown
exponentially and during the same period

253
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:26,451
the number of potentially world-ending
events has risen at a commensurate rate.

254
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:31,398
Are you saying it's our fault?
I am saying there may be a causality.

255
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:40,292
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict. And conflict...

256
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,679
...breeds catastrophe.

257
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,826
<i>Oversight....</i>

258
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:52,390
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand. Boom.

259
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,007
Tony....

260
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:58,337
You are being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already made up his mind.

261
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,617
Boy, you know me so well.

262
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,115
Actually, I am nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

263
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,294
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

264
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,740
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal?

265
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,507
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

266
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:25,140
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.

267
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,438
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA, had
a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall.

268
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,140
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

269
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,069
...before he parked it behind a desk.
See the world. Maybe be of service.

270
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,005
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.

271
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:44,992
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

272
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:50,921
He decided to spend his summer building sustainable
housing for the poor. Guess where. Sokovia.

273
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,853
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
And we won't know because we dropped

274
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:59,710
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

275
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,890
There's no decision-making process here.

276
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,049
We need to be put in check!

277
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,549
Whatever form that takes, I am game.

278
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:20,039
If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary
less we're no better than the bad guys.

279
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,640
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up. Who said we're giving up?

280
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,299
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.

281
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,163
This document just shifts the blame.
I am sorry, Steve. That....

282
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,999
That is dangerously arrogant.

283
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,109
This is the United Nations we're talking about.

284
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,500
It's not the World Security Council,

285
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,270
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people

286
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,730
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I am here.

287
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,423
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

288
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:49,579
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.

289
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,818
If we sign this,
we surrender our right to choose.

290
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,021
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

291
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,691
What if there is somewhere we need to go
and they don't let us?

292
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,153
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.

293
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:06,450
If we don't do this now,
it's going to be done to us later.

294
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,863
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they will come for me.

295
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:13,376
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.

296
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:19,993
If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer.
If we take it off... Aren't you the same woman...

297
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:25,009
...who told the government to kiss her ass
a few years ago? I am just reading the terrain.

298
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:30,240
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.

299
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,640
Focus up. I am sorry. Did I just mishear you...

300
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,561
or did you agree with me? I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented.

301
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,941
Okay.
Case closed. I win.

302
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,388
I have to go.

303
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:32,114
And now, I would like to invite Sharon
Carter to come up and say a few words.

304
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:48,699
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

305
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:51,849
...but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

306
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:59,150
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

307
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,823
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

308
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:07,241
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told anyone we were related.

309
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:12,400
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...

310
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,948
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

311
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:19,476
She said, compromise where you can.

312
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,409
But where you can't, don't.

313
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:29,800
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.

314
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,099
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

315
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:37,099
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

316
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,819
look them in the eye and say "No, you move."

317
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,131
When I came out of the ice,
I thought everyone I had known was gone.

318
00:33:58,378 --> 00:34:00,909
Then I found out she was alive.

319
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,788
I was just lucky to have her.

320
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,847
She had you back, too.

321
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,568
<i>Who else signed?</i>

322
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,239
<i>Tony, Rhodey, Vision.</i>

323
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,260
<i>Clint?</i>

324
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,637
Says he's retired.
Wanda? TBD.

325
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:25,869
I am off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.

326
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:34,505
Just because it's the path of least resistance
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

327
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,804
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

328
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,405
What are we giving up to do it?

329
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,996
I am sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.

330
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,512
<i>I know.</i>

331
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,552
Then what are you doing here?

332
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,177
I didn't want you to be alone.

333
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,447
<i>Come here.</i>

334
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:15,614
<i>At a special United Nations conference...</i>

335
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:21,036
<i>117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.</i>

336
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,713
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
Yes? These need your signature.

337
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,108
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

338
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:39,304
I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
Oh. Well, it's not always so flattering.

339
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,054
You seem to be doing all right so far.

340
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,559
Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill...

341
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,420
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company. Well, I am not.

342
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,409
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.

343
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:57,960
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes. The politics, not really.

344
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,820
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

345
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,684
Unless you need to move a piano.

346
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:11,900
Ms Romanoff. King T'Chaka. Please, allow me
to apologise for what happened in Nigeria.

347
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,550
Thank you.

348
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,099
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

349
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,300
I am sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

350
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,681
<i>Yes, so am I. If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.</i>

351
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:26,971
That is the future calling.

352
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:30,998
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.

353
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,851
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,

354
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,481
you're getting quite good at it.

355
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,644
I'm happy, Father.

356
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:46,653
Thank you.

357
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,364
Thank you.

358
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,376
<i>When stolen Wakandan vibranium....</i>

359
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,380
<i>...was used to make a terrible weapon...</i>

360
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,739
<i>....we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.</i>

361
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,420
Those men and women killed in Nigeria
were part of a goodwill mission...

362
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,161
...from a country too long in the shadows.

363
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,063
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

364
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:15,083
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

365
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:19,626
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

366
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:27,353
Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!

367
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:05,998
My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

368
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:08,318
She bought me my first thigh holster.

369
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:10,250
Very practical.

370
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,010
And stylish.

371
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:22,050
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

372
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,012
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?

373
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:31,063
I have been meaning to ask you.

374
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:36,416
When you were spying on me from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.

375
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,219
Did Peggy know?

376
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:44,565
She kept so many secrets.

377
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:47,179
I didn't want her to have one from you.

378
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,762
Thanks for walking me back.

379
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,208
Sure.

380
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,918
Steve.
There's something you got to see.

381
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:05,269
<i>A bomb hidden in a news van ripped through the
UN building in Vienna. Who's coordinating? Good.</i>

382
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:07,235
They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.

383
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:11,230
<i>At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.</i>

384
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,132
<i>Officials have released a video of a suspect...</i>

385
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:17,358
<i>who they have identified as James
Buchanan Barnes the Winter Soldier.</i>

386
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:18,893
<i>The infamous HYDRA agent...</i>

387
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:24,577
<i>....linked to numerous acts of terrorism and
political assassinations. I have to go to work.</i>

388
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,784
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

389
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:35,885
We need the whole team here in two hours
or it's not worth it.

390
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,221
I am very sorry.

391
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,295
In my culture...

392
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:58,650
.....death is not the end.

393
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:03,431
It's more of a stepping-off point.

394
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:08,237
You reach out with both hands
and Bast and Sekhmet,

395
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:11,614
they lead you into the green veldt where...

396
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,867
....you can run forever.

397
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,217
That sounds very peaceful.

398
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,197
My father thought so.

399
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:25,641
I am not my father.
T'Challa...

400
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:29,240
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

401
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,996
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.

402
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,972
I will kill him myself.

403
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:47,833
Yeah? You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.

404
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:57,215
I know how much Barnes means to you.
I really do.

405
00:40:57,215 --> 00:41:02,489
Stay home. You will only make this worse.
For all of us.

406
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:06,405
<i>Please.
Are you saying you will arrest me? No.</i>

407
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:10,989
Someone will. If you interfere.
That's how it works now.

408
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:15,385
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in. Why?

409
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:18,494
Because I am the one
least likely to die trying.

410
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,579
<i>Shit....</i>

411
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:27,740
She tell you to stay out of it?

412
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,500
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.

413
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,025
1945, maybe. I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

414
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:39,974
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.

415
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,400
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

416
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,632
Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier goes to
their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this.

417
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:56,690
My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now
so that's all the head start you're going to get.

418
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,989
Thank you.
You're going to have to hurry.

419
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:02,728
We have orders to shoot on sight.

420
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,523
<i>Homecoming</i>

421
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,170
<i>One</i>

422
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,717
<i>One</i>

423
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,793
<i>Freight car</i>

424
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,273
I have your breakfast.

425
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,992
I could smell it before I opened the door.

426
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,009
Side of bacon and black coffee.

427
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:44,920
Again.

428
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,170
I can make you something different, if you like.

429
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,141
This is wonderful...

430
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:49,699
I will just put this on your...

431
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,898
It's okay, I can manage!

432
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:28,653
<i>Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces, approaching from the south.</i>

433
00:44:28,653 --> 00:44:30,452
Understood.

434
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,610
Do you know me?

435
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,760
You're Steve.

436
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:50,019
I read about you in a museum.
They have set the perimeter.

437
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:54,951
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.

438
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,291
But you're lying.

439
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,108
I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.

440
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:04,949
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.

441
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:10,384
And they're not planning on taking you alive.
That's smart. Good strategy.

442
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,630
<i>They're on the roof.
I am compromised.</i>

443
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,619
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.

444
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:25,599
<i>- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.</i>

445
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,409
You pulled me from the river.
Why?

446
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:33,353
<i>- I don't know.
- Three seconds. Yes, you do.</i>

447
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,829
<i>Breach....
Breach..... Breach....</i>

448
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,612
Buck, stop!
You're going to kill someone.

449
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,947
I am not going to kill anyone.

450
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:51,260
Suspect has broken containment!

451
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,827
...he's headed down the east stairwell!

452
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,530
<i>Come on, man.</i>

453
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:27,952
Ahhh.......

454
00:48:09,255 --> 00:48:14,065
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy? About to find out.

455
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:28,436
<i>- Sam.
- Got him.</i>

456
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,735
<i>Stand down......</i>

457
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,469
<i>Stand down......</i>

458
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:47,396
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.

459
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:24,670
<i>Stand down, now.</i>

460
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:35,128
<i>Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.</i>

461
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:59,275
<i>Your Highness.</i>

462
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,000
"A pinch of paprika."

463
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,925
"A pinch."

464
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:17,923
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.

465
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,132
Spirits lifted.

466
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:42,074
In my defence, I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so... May I? Please.

467
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:52,847
- Wanda?
- Hmm. No one dislikes you, Wanda.

468
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,929
Thanks. Oh, you're welcome. No.

469
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:03,456
It's a involuntary response in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you. Are you?

470
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:06,188
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

471
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:13,373
I used to think of myself one way, but...

472
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:15,862
.....after this...

473
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:22,922
I am something else.
I am still me, I think, but...

474
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:27,213
...that's not what everyone else sees.

475
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,300
Do you know, I don't know what this is?

476
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,500
Not really.

477
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:40,601
I know it's not of this world that it powered
Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but...

478
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:47,300
...its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.

479
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,980
Are you afraid of it?

480
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:51,650
I wish to understand it.

481
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,983
The more I do, the less it controls me.

482
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:57,068
One day... who knows?

483
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,284
I may even control it.

484
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:05,637
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

485
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:08,507
I am going to go to the store.

486
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:14,438
I will be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

487
00:54:14,702 --> 00:54:18,483
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

488
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:24,128
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.

489
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:26,755
<i>Not yours.</i>

490
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:32,675
Mr Stark would like to avoid the possibility
of another public incident.

491
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:37,704
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

492
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,925
And what do you want?

493
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,856
For people to see you...

494
00:54:44,856 --> 00:54:46,998
....as I do.

495
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:22,800
So, you like cats?
Sam. What?

496
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,181
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't want to know more?

497
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:30,242
Your suit... it's vibranium?

498
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:37,427
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.

499
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,710
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.

500
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:46,298
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

501
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:49,463
I also wear the mantle of king.

502
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,557
So, I ask you...

503
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,641
as both warrior and king...

504
00:55:55,853 --> 00:56:00,213
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

505
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,889
What's going to happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

506
00:56:22,889 --> 00:56:25,422
Psychological evaluation and extradition.

507
00:56:25,422 --> 00:56:30,998
This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer? Lawyer. That's funny.

508
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:35,036
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We will write you a receipt.

509
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:39,349
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

510
00:56:44,594 --> 00:56:50,242
You will be provided with an office instead
of a cell. Now, do me a favour, stay in it?

511
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,681
I don't intend on going anywhere.

512
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:59,393
For the record, this is what making things
worse looks like. He's alive. No.

513
00:56:59,393 --> 00:57:01,802
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

514
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:05,983
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup. Try not
to break anything while we fix this. Consequences?

515
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:08,429
You bet there will be consequences.

516
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:11,922
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?

517
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:15,429
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?

518
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,449
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.

519
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:22,248
I am not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the government's property.

520
00:57:22,248 --> 00:57:26,376
Wings, too. That's cold.
Warmer than jail.

521
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:55,902
Hey, you want to see something cool?

522
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,860
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

523
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,599
Felt timely.

524
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,289
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

525
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,574
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

526
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:15,380
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

527
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:19,271
See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here.

528
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:25,753
I am trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.

529
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,887
Is that what you call it?

530
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,967
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

531
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:41,192
We're kind of... Well, not kind of... Pregnant?
No. Definitely not. We are taking a break.

532
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:42,992
It's nobody's fault.

533
00:58:43,746 --> 00:58:46,300
I am so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

534
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,250
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

535
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,699
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.

536
00:58:54,699 --> 00:59:01,490
And then, and then, and then, I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't want to stop.

537
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:07,394
I don't want to lose her. I thought maybe
the Accords could split the difference.

538
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:13,101
In her defence, I am a handful.

539
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:18,400
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.

540
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,500
You know, I am glad Howard got married.

541
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,730
I only knew him when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

542
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,349
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.

543
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:31,789
God, I hated you.

544
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:37,380
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're a very polite person.

545
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,489
If I see a situation pointed south...

546
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:45,996
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could. No, you don't.

547
00:59:47,827 --> 00:59:50,226
<i>No, I don't.</i>

548
00:59:50,226 --> 00:59:54,998
Sometimes... Sometimes I want to
punch you in your perfect teeth.

549
00:59:54,998 --> 00:59:59,300
But I don't want to see you gone.
We need you, Cap.

550
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,300
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

551
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,414
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

552
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:10,414
Barnes gets transferred to an American
psych-centre instead of a Wakandan prison.

553
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:26,519
I am not saying it's impossible but there
would have to be safeguards. Sure.

554
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:30,476
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.

555
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:34,050
I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda
reinstated... Wanda? What about Wanda?

556
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,407
She's fine.
She's confined to the compound, currently.

557
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:38,757
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.

558
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:42,797
Every time I think you see things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

559
01:00:42,797 --> 01:00:46,500
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people. Protection?

560
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,650
Is that how you see this?

561
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,809
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
She's not a US citizen.

562
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:54,061
And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass
destruction. Oh, come on, Tony. She's a kid!

563
01:00:54,061 --> 01:00:56,197
Give me a break!

564
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:58,661
I am doing what has to be done.

565
01:00:58,661 --> 01:01:01,222
To stave off something worse.

566
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,141
You keep telling yourself that.

567
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,856
Hate to break up the set.

568
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:22,309
<i>Hello, Mr Barnes. I have been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.</i>

569
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:24,722
<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>

570
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:31,954
<i>Your first name is James?</i>

571
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:34,976
The receipt for your gear.

572
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:40,255
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.

573
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:50,565
<i>I am not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.</i>

574
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:54,009
<i>Do you know where you are, James?</i>

575
01:01:56,581 --> 01:02:00,190
<i>I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.</i>

576
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,780
<i>My name is Bucky.</i>

577
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,844
Hello.....?

578
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:18,545
Asshole....

579
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,416
Hey......

580
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:44,309
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

581
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:46,817
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

582
01:02:46,817 --> 01:02:51,891
Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out
of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

583
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:54,097
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.

584
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:56,000
You're saying someone framed him to find him?

585
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,398
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.

586
01:02:58,398 --> 01:03:02,456
We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever

587
01:03:02,456 --> 01:03:05,721
framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.

588
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,905
<i>Yeah....</i>

589
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:19,391
Tell me, Bucky.
You have seen a great deal, haven't you?

590
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,844
<i>I don't want to talk about it.</i>

591
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:28,018
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.

592
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,481
Don't worry.

593
01:03:35,704 --> 01:03:38,295
We only have to talk about one.

594
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:50,800
What is this?

595
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,291
Alright. Come on, guys.
Get me eyes on Barnes.

596
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:08,206
Friday, get me a source on that outage.

597
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:11,333
Sub-level five, East Wing.

598
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:17,807
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?

599
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:21,722
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

600
01:04:21,722 --> 01:04:25,958
I mean your real home.

601
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,052
<i>Longing</i>

602
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:34,764
No....

603
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:36,898
<i>Rusted</i>

604
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:38,081
<i>Stop....</i>

605
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,858
<i>Seventeen</i>

606
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,096
<i>Stop....</i>

607
01:04:44,974 --> 01:04:46,173
<i>Daybreak</i>

608
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:53,431
<i>Furnace</i>

609
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:56,976
<i>Nine</i>

610
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,431
<i>Benign</i>

611
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:06,581
<i>Homecoming</i>

612
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:08,329
<i>One</i>

613
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:10,690
<i>Freight car</i>

614
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,478
Soldier?

615
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:32,686
Ready to comply.

616
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:39,291
Mission report. December 16, 1991.

617
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,119
<i>Help me.</i>

618
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,539
<i>Help.</i>

619
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,753
<i>Get up.</i>

620
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:01,936
Who are you? What do you want?

621
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:05,617
To see an empire fall.

622
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:38,077
Hey.....

623
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:48,885
Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around
the building, and gunships in the air.

624
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:50,306
Please tell me you brought a suit.

625
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:55,137
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece,
two-button. I am an active-duty non-combatant.

626
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,806
<i>Follow me.</i>

627
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:15,021
<i>We're in position.</i>

628
01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:49,516
You could at least recognise me.

629
01:08:41,752 --> 01:08:43,561
<i>Damn it.</i>

630
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:24,770
<i>He asked me again if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.</i>

631
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,185
<i>You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?</i>

632
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:32,247
<i>I am going to bed.
I love you.</i>

633
01:10:35,323 --> 01:10:39,734
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...

634
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,300
...escaped custody today.

635
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,465
...also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

636
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:46,190
and Sam Wilson.

637
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:11,195
<i>Hey, Cap!</i>

638
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:25,112
Steve.....

639
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:27,997
Which Bucky am I talking to?

640
01:11:29,043 --> 01:11:31,934
Your mom's name was Sarah.

641
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:39,408
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.

642
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,702
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?

643
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:47,853
What did I do? Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

644
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:50,512
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

645
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:54,291
All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
Who was he? I don't know.

646
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:59,109
People are dead. The bombing, the setup the doctor
did all that just to get 10 minutes with you.

647
01:11:59,109 --> 01:12:01,698
I need you to do better than "I don't know."

648
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:07,842
He wanted to know about Siberia.

649
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,020
Where I was kept.

650
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:17,725
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?

651
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:22,952
Because I am not the only Winter Soldier.

652
01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:17,688
It hurts!

653
01:13:54,715 --> 01:13:56,574
Good work.

654
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:09,041
Get me out of here.

655
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:25,948
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.

656
01:14:25,948 --> 01:14:29,677
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.

657
01:14:29,677 --> 01:14:35,201
They all turn out like you?
Worse. The doctor, could he control them?

658
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:40,234
Enough. Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.

659
01:14:40,234 --> 01:14:45,752
They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.

660
01:14:45,752 --> 01:14:49,931
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.

661
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:53,990
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.

662
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,399
If we call Tony... No, he won't believe us.

663
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,176
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords would let him help.

664
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,498
We're on our own.

665
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,457
Maybe not.

666
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,818
I know a guy.

667
01:15:07,818 --> 01:15:12,524
And I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are? We will.

668
01:15:12,524 --> 01:15:16,251
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.

669
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:19,865
They will get a hit. We will handle it.
You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle.

670
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:23,854
It's clear you can't be objective.
I am putting Special Ops on this.

671
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:26,569
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

672
01:15:26,569 --> 01:15:28,037
If we're provoked.

673
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:31,500
Barnes would have been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

674
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,970
There are dead people who would be alive now.

675
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,149
Feel free to check my math.

676
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:41,162
All due respect, you're not going to solve
this with boys and bullets, Ross.

677
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,605
You got to let us bring them in. How would
that end any differently than last time?

678
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:48,380
Because this time,
I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt.

679
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:53,168
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.

680
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,108
<i>Barnes....</i>

681
01:15:56,811 --> 01:16:01,981
<i>Rogers. Wilson.
Thank you, sir.</i>

682
01:16:05,304 --> 01:16:08,583
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

683
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:14,184
- You all right?
- Always.

684
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:21,824
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.

685
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:27,189
Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?

686
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:33,800
You really think he'd be on our side?
No. I have an idea.

687
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:40,148
- Me, too. Where's yours?
- Downstairs. Where's yours?

688
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,639
- Hey, May.
- Mmm. Hey.

689
01:17:06,064 --> 01:17:12,301
How was school today? It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.

690
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:17,859
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...

691
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:25,132
What... What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I am Peter. Tony.

692
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:28,193
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.

693
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:30,100
You have been getting my emails, right?

694
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,310
Yeah. Right? Yeah. Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

695
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:38,284
About the grant. The September Foundation.
Right. Yeah. Remember when you applied?

696
01:17:38,284 --> 01:17:42,199
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.

697
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,689
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

698
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:46,573
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know....

699
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:50,449
...how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know, but...

700
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:53,261
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I am here to hash out. OK.

701
01:17:53,261 --> 01:17:57,399
Hash it out, okay. It's so hard for
me to believe that she's someone's aunt.

702
01:17:57,399 --> 01:18:00,100
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

703
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,905
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Let me just stop you there. Yeah.

704
01:18:03,905 --> 01:18:10,756
Is this grant got money involved or whatever? No?
Yeah. Yeah? It's pretty well funded. Wow.

705
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:12,109
Look who you're talking to.

706
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:15,122
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

707
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:24,127
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.

708
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:29,699
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

709
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:32,954
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver? Yeah, I was...

710
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:34,502
Anyway, look, um,

711
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:37,619
I definitely did not apply for your grant...
Ah-ah! Me first.

712
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:41,105
Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

713
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:47,606
That's you, right? Um, no.
What do you mean? Yeah.

714
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,427
Look at you go.

715
01:18:49,427 --> 01:18:52,831
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

716
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:57,658
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

717
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:00,587
I mean, that's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.

718
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:01,811
It's all done on the computer.

719
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:05,279
Mmm-hmm. It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

720
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,627
Oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly. Oh, what have we here?

721
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:13,815
Uh... so......

722
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:17,615
So.....

723
01:19:18,663 --> 01:19:23,735
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?

724
01:19:25,378 --> 01:19:29,969
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.

725
01:19:29,969 --> 01:19:31,935
It's not a onesie.

726
01:19:32,752 --> 01:19:36,618
I don't believe this. I was actually having
a really good day today, you know Mr Stark.

727
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:40,560
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there, and...

728
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,704
....Algebra test, nailed it.

729
01:19:43,704 --> 01:19:46,364
Who else knows?
Anybody?

730
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:54,670
Nobody. Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No. No! If she knew, she would freak out.

731
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:59,699
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool? This webbing.

732
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:05,969
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that? I did.

733
01:20:06,252 --> 01:20:09,654
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?

734
01:20:09,654 --> 01:20:17,250
It's a long story. I was... Lordy!
Can you even see in these? Yes, I can. I am blind!

735
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:22,395
I can see in those. Okay?
It's just that when whatever happened, happened...

736
01:20:22,395 --> 01:20:25,076
...it's like my senses have been dialled to 11.

737
01:20:25,076 --> 01:20:29,800
There's way too much input,
so they just kind of help me focus.

738
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,100
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

739
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:36,568
Systemic, top to bottom, 100-point restoration.
That's why I am here.

740
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,523
Why you doing this?

741
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:44,809
I got to know, what's your MO? What gets you
out of that twin bed in the morning?

742
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,743
Because......

743
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:54,402
Because I have been me my whole life,
and I have had these powers for six months.

744
01:20:54,402 --> 01:20:58,890
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.

745
01:20:59,197 --> 01:21:02,067
And yeah, I would love to play football,

746
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:05,654
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different. Exactly.

747
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:08,532
But I can't tell anybody that, so I am not.

748
01:21:11,804 --> 01:21:17,243
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

749
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,288
....and then the bad things happen...

750
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:24,256
....they happen because of you.

751
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:31,333
So you want to look out for the little guy,
you want to do your part?

752
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:36,529
Make the world a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

753
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:39,082
<i>That's what it is.</i>

754
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,595
I am going to sit here, so you move the leg.

755
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,039
You got a passport?

756
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:02,498
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
You ever been to Germany? No. Oh, you will love it.

757
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:05,139
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

758
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:08,675
I got homework.

759
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:11,704
I am going to pretend you didn't say that.
No, I am being serious.

760
01:22:11,704 --> 01:22:14,149
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.

761
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:17,157
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I am taking you on a field trip.

762
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:20,850
Don't tell Aunt May.

763
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,359
All right, Spider-Man.

764
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:29,408
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I will get the...

765
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:44,998
- What is it?
- Stay here, please.

766
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:58,764
Guess I should have knocked. Oh, my God!
What are you doing here? Disappointing my kids.

767
01:23:01,703 --> 01:23:04,262
I am supposed to go waterskiing.

768
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:07,983
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!

769
01:23:09,202 --> 01:23:11,202
You should not be here.

770
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,523
Really...?

771
01:23:14,523 --> 01:23:18,113
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

772
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:24,984
Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered. Okay, we got to go.

773
01:23:28,255 --> 01:23:33,226
It's this way.
I have caused enough problems.

774
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:40,493
You got to help me, Wanda. Look.
You want to mope, you can go to high school.

775
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:45,560
You want to make amends,
you get off your ass. Shit....

776
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:53,301
I knew I should have stretched.

777
01:24:06,301 --> 01:24:11,310
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't....

778
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,469
...but she can.

779
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:18,297
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

780
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,768
I am leaving.
I can't let you.

781
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,659
I am sorry.

782
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:36,863
If you do this
they will never stop being afraid of you.

783
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:41,645
I can't control their fear, only my own.

784
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,422
Oh...

785
01:24:56,141 --> 01:25:01,346
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.

786
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:06,686
Our satellites are running facial,
biometric, and behavioural pattern scans.

787
01:25:09,764 --> 01:25:13,413
Move or you will be moved.

788
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:19,307
As entertaining as that would be.
You really think you can find him?

789
01:25:19,307 --> 01:25:23,792
My resources are considerable. Yeah.
It took the world 70 years to find Barnes...

790
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:27,012
...so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

791
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:31,539
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.

792
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:38,315
Not sure you understand the concept
of a getaway car. It's low profile.

793
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:41,703
Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd.

794
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:49,993
Can you move your seat up?
No. I owe you again. Keeping a list.

795
01:25:51,957 --> 01:25:58,336
You know, he kind of tried to kill me.
Sorry. I will put it on the list, too.

796
01:26:00,873 --> 01:26:05,268
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.

797
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,342
Thank you, Sharon.

798
01:26:23,497 --> 01:26:28,166
- That was....
- Late. Damn right.

799
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,538
I should go.
Okay.

800
01:26:58,206 --> 01:27:02,161
Cap. You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

801
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:06,097
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.

802
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:09,949
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.

803
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:13,548
How about our other recruit?
He's raring to go.

804
01:27:13,947 --> 01:27:16,490
Had to put a little coffee in him, but...

805
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,490
.....he should be good.

806
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:25,703
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.

807
01:27:27,027 --> 01:27:32,372
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang. It's an honour.

808
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:35,720
I am shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!

809
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,100
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

810
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,006
Jeez. Ah, look, I want to say,

811
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:47,684
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

812
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,149
....thinks for thanking of me.

813
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:53,354
- Hey, man! What's up, Tic Tac?
- Uh, good to see you.

814
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:58,319
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition, but it'll never happen again.

815
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:00,728
They tell you what we're up against?

816
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:04,108
Something about some psycho-assassins?

817
01:28:04,108 --> 01:28:06,283
We're outside the law on this one.

818
01:28:06,283 --> 01:28:08,739
So if you come with us, you're a wanted man.

819
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:13,889
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving. We got a chopper lined up.

820
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:22,747
- They're evacuating the airport.
- Stark. Stark?

821
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:25,287
Suit up.

822
01:28:45,438 --> 01:28:47,802
<i>Wow, it's so weird
how you run into people at the airport.</i>

823
01:28:47,802 --> 01:28:50,907
<i>- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird. Hear me out, Tony.</i>

824
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:54,844
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

825
01:28:57,417 --> 01:29:01,520
<i>Captain.
Your Highness. Anyway.....</i>

826
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,800
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

827
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,920
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

828
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,831
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.

829
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:16,296
Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more super soldiers just like him.

830
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:20,377
I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony.
I can't. Steve....

831
01:29:20,377 --> 01:29:23,134
...you know what's about to happen.

832
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:26,248
Do you really want to
punch your way out of this one?

833
01:29:29,356 --> 01:29:33,716
All right, I have run out of patience.
Underoos!

834
01:29:37,882 --> 01:29:42,529
Nice job, kid. Thanks. I could have stuck
the landing a little better, it's just...

835
01:29:42,529 --> 01:29:45,654
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.

836
01:29:45,654 --> 01:29:49,920
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.

837
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,890
Big fan. I am Spider-Man. Yeah. We will talk
about it later. Just... Hey, everyone. Good job.

838
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,141
You have been busy.
And you have been a complete idiot.

839
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:03,018
Dragging in Clint "Rescuing" Wanda from a place
she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place.

840
01:30:03,018 --> 01:30:04,998
I am trying to keep...

841
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:09,076
I am trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

842
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,823
You did that when you signed.

843
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:14,100
All right, we're done.

844
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,399
You're going to turn Barnes over, you are going
to come with us, now, because it's us...

845
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:22,865
....or a squad of J-SOC guys with
no compunction about being impolite.

846
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,239
Come on.

847
01:30:26,805 --> 01:30:28,746
<i>We found it.</i>

848
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:32,731
Their Quinjet's in hangar five, north runway.

849
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,998
<i>All right, Lang.</i>

850
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:41,905
Hey, guys, something... Whoa.
What the hell was that?

851
01:30:41,905 --> 01:30:45,122
<i>I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.</i>

852
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:48,386
All right, there's two on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff, I am going to grab her.

853
01:30:48,386 --> 01:30:51,997
<i>Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.</i>

854
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:53,605
<i>Barnes is mine.</i>

855
01:30:54,002 --> 01:30:56,698
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.

856
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:59,579
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.

857
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,201
<i>Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.</i>

858
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:13,779
<i>Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.</i>

859
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:29,488
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

860
01:31:35,332 --> 01:31:39,216
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.

861
01:31:39,801 --> 01:31:42,610
You have the right to remain silent!

862
01:31:56,095 --> 01:32:00,175
<i>Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you
but it ain't going to tickle either.</i>

863
01:32:04,304 --> 01:32:08,216
<i>Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.</i>

864
01:32:08,216 --> 01:32:12,300
<i>Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.</i>

865
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,600
<i>Hey, Clint. Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.</i>

866
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,194
<i>You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.</i>

867
01:32:20,194 --> 01:32:22,930
Just can't seem to miss.

868
01:32:23,957 --> 01:32:27,817
<i>You know, first time for everything.
Made you look.</i>

869
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:41,567
<i>Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.</i>

870
01:32:48,555 --> 01:32:50,195
Oh, God....

871
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:53,421
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

872
01:32:58,065 --> 01:32:59,926
Ahh......

873
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:07,630
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?

874
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,519
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

875
01:33:09,519 --> 01:33:12,855
which, got to say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you have been in a fight before...

876
01:33:12,855 --> 01:33:16,381
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.

877
01:33:20,563 --> 01:33:22,332
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,

878
01:33:22,332 --> 01:33:27,890
but I have only got one job here today and
I got to impress Mr Stark, so, I am really sorry.

879
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:33,039
You couldn't have done that earlier?

880
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,171
<i>I hate you.</i>

881
01:33:40,957 --> 01:33:44,137
<i>Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!</i>

882
01:33:45,253 --> 01:33:48,854
<i>Throw it at this.
Now.....</i>

883
01:33:51,461 --> 01:33:53,650
<i>Oh....
Come on!</i>

884
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,649
<i>Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.</i>

885
01:34:02,255 --> 01:34:05,250
<i>All right, now I am pissed.</i>

886
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:10,356
Is this part of the plan? Well.
My plan was go easy on 'em. You wanna switch it up?

887
01:34:12,023 --> 01:34:14,122
There's our ride.

888
01:34:15,484 --> 01:34:16,993
<i>Come on!</i>

889
01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:27,199
Captain Rogers.....

890
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:31,100
....I know you believe
what you are doing is right.

891
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:36,197
But for the collective good
you must surrender now.

892
01:34:52,712 --> 01:34:54,943
What do we do, Cap?

893
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,100
<i>We fight.</i>

894
01:34:57,886 --> 01:35:00,706
This is going to end well.

895
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:10,154
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.

896
01:35:40,243 --> 01:35:44,197
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.

897
01:35:51,881 --> 01:35:54,341
You were pulling your punches.

898
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:01,952
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?

899
01:36:19,233 --> 01:36:21,670
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

900
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:24,064
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

901
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,467
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.

902
01:36:34,681 --> 01:36:37,631
He also said to go for your legs.

903
01:36:44,391 --> 01:36:46,091
Ahhh......

904
01:36:48,448 --> 01:36:51,760
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?

905
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,548
<i>Yeah. No, I am good.
I am good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!</i>

906
01:37:16,782 --> 01:37:23,900
Stark tell you anything else? That you're wrong.
You think you're right. That makes you dangerous.

907
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,322
Guess he had a point.

908
01:37:34,608 --> 01:37:39,712
<i>You got heart, kid. Where you from?
"Queens".</i>

909
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,038
<i>"Brooklyn".</i>

910
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:51,100
<i>Friday? We have some weapon systems offline.
What?</i>

911
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:55,252
<i>Oh, you're going to have to take this
into the shop. Who's speaking?</i>

912
01:37:55,252 --> 01:38:02,328
<i>It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday? Deploying fire suppression system.</i>

913
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:04,069
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

914
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:07,331
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

915
01:38:09,002 --> 01:38:10,643
<i>Whoa....</i>

916
01:38:15,774 --> 01:38:18,431
We got to go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

917
01:38:18,431 --> 01:38:21,778
We got to draw out the flyers.
I will take Vision, you get to the jet.

918
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:25,195
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!

919
01:38:26,586 --> 01:38:29,631
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...

920
01:38:29,631 --> 01:38:32,778
<i>....if we're going to win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.</i>

921
01:38:32,778 --> 01:38:34,989
<i>This isn't the real fight, Steve.</i>

922
01:38:34,989 --> 01:38:39,775
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.

923
01:38:40,632 --> 01:38:44,295
<i>I got something kind of big.
But I can't hold it very long.</i>

924
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,489
<i>On my signal, run like hell.</i>

925
01:38:46,489 --> 01:38:50,547
<i>And if I tear myself in half, don't come
back for me. He's going to tear himself in half?</i>

926
01:38:50,547 --> 01:38:53,119
<i>You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.</i>

927
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:57,344
<i>I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.</i>

928
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,998
<i>I am the boss.
I am the boss, I am the boss.</i>

929
01:39:15,002 --> 01:39:17,442
Holy shit.....

930
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:23,720
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

931
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:28,255
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!

932
01:39:29,131 --> 01:39:31,822
Give me back my Rhodey.

933
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,430
I got him.

934
01:39:58,006 --> 01:40:03,287
Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose...

935
01:40:03,287 --> 01:40:05,412
I am open to suggestions.

936
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:16,064
<i>You want to get to them,
you got to go through me.</i>

937
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,189
<i>Uh......</i>

938
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:44,146
We haven't met yet.

939
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:49,162
<i>- I am Clint.
- I don't care.</i>

940
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,731
Whoa....

941
01:41:08,671 --> 01:41:09,971
Ahhh....

942
01:41:16,162 --> 01:41:17,662
Get off!

943
01:41:31,554 --> 01:41:34,264
<i>Something just flew in me!</i>

944
01:41:57,395 --> 01:42:03,444
You're not going to stop.
You know I can't. I am going to regret this.

945
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:07,511
<i>"Go".</i>

946
01:42:12,786 --> 01:42:17,199
<i>Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?</i>

947
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:21,851
<i>Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy? I don't know,
I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.</i>

948
01:42:22,796 --> 01:42:27,189
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet....

949
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:29,876
....with the walking thingies?

950
01:42:31,006 --> 01:42:34,506
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.

951
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:45,796
- Yes....
- That was awesome!

952
01:42:59,524 --> 01:43:03,225
Does anyone have any orange slices?

953
01:43:08,274 --> 01:43:14,840
Kid, you all right? Hey. Whoa. Hey. Same side.
Wait a minute... Guess who. Hey. Hi. It's me.

954
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,257
- Hey, man. Yeah.
- That was scary.

955
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:21,301
Yeah. You're done, all right? What?
You did a good job. Stay down. I am good, I am fine.

956
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:23,864
Stay down. No, it's good. I got to get him back.
You're going home or I will call Aunt May!

957
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:30,403
- Dude. You're done! Wait. Mr Stark, wait.
- I am not done. I am not....

958
01:43:31,364 --> 01:43:34,454
Okay, I am done.
I am done.

959
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:55,175
I said I'd help you find him, not catch him.
There's a difference.

960
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:04,670
I am sorry.
Me, too.

961
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:06,390
It's as I said.....

962
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:08,778
<i>....Catastrophe.</i>

963
01:44:20,706 --> 01:44:23,735
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

964
01:44:27,296 --> 01:44:31,873
<i>Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster, turn him into a glider.</i>

965
01:44:45,948 --> 01:44:47,368
<i>Rhodey.....</i>

966
01:44:48,567 --> 01:44:51,157
Tony, I am flying dead stick.

967
01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:00,546
Rhodes.....

968
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:18,493
Read vitals. Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.

969
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:24,318
<i>I am sorry.</i>

970
01:45:45,515 --> 01:45:47,725
- this is room 201...

971
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,789
Bacon and black coffee again today?

972
01:45:51,462 --> 01:45:53,613
You know me so well...

973
01:45:54,632 --> 01:45:57,073
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

974
01:45:57,569 --> 01:45:59,069
May I let myself in?

975
01:46:23,636 --> 01:46:25,957
What's going to happen to your friends?

976
01:46:33,956 --> 01:46:35,895
Whatever it is...

977
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,012
I will deal with it.

978
01:46:40,695 --> 01:46:43,525
I don't know if I am worth all this, Steve.

979
01:46:49,896 --> 01:46:52,417
What you did all those years...

980
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:54,666
It wasn't you.

981
01:46:55,002 --> 01:46:57,202
You didn't have a choice.

982
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,792
I know.

983
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,585
But I did it.

984
01:47:18,609 --> 01:47:23,554
How did this happen?
I became distracted.

985
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:27,989
I didn't think that was possible.

986
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,244
Neither did I.

987
01:47:46,712 --> 01:47:53,252
The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

988
01:47:53,252 --> 01:47:56,831
Probably looking at some form of paralysis.

989
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:01,206
Steve's not going to stop.

990
01:48:01,206 --> 01:48:05,426
If you don't either, Rhodey's going to be
the best case scenario. You let them go, Nat.

991
01:48:05,426 --> 01:48:08,300
We played this wrong.
"We"?

992
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:13,520
Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole
double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.

993
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:19,777
Are you incapable of letting go
of your ego for one goddamn second?

994
01:48:23,114 --> 01:48:26,225
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...

995
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,090
....they're coming for you.

996
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:32,998
I am not the one that needs
to watch their back.

997
01:48:40,815 --> 01:48:45,545
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.

998
01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:49,997
Fire up the chopper.

999
01:48:55,063 --> 01:48:59,100
<i>The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>

1000
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:03,057
<i>The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.</i>

1001
01:49:03,057 --> 01:49:04,748
<i>He was met by this man.</i>

1002
01:49:04,748 --> 01:49:07,380
<i>Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?</i>

1003
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:11,301
Uh, I don't know. I have been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.

1004
01:49:11,301 --> 01:49:15,998
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo.

1005
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:18,729
<i>Sokovian Intelligence.</i>

1006
01:49:19,212 --> 01:49:24,600
<i>Zemo ran Echo Scorpion
a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>

1007
01:49:25,911 --> 01:49:29,966
So, what happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.

1008
01:49:29,966 --> 01:49:32,840
<i>Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...</i>

1009
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,856
<i>approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</i>

1010
01:49:37,856 --> 01:49:40,195
Son of a bitch.

1011
01:49:41,301 --> 01:49:44,360
<i>- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.</i>

1012
01:51:16,997 --> 01:51:21,998
<i>This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.</i>

1013
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,380
So? You got the files?

1014
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:59,720
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1015
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:04,300
You seriously think I am going to listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1016
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,344
You're lucky you're not in one of these cells.

1017
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:44,881
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here! He sees all!

1018
01:52:44,881 --> 01:52:48,756
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1019
01:52:48,756 --> 01:52:52,887
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea they'd put you here. Come on.

1020
01:52:52,887 --> 01:52:56,061
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1021
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:59,192
Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey.

1022
01:52:59,192 --> 01:53:03,690
You know, this place is for maniacs.
This is a place for... Criminals?

1023
01:53:04,404 --> 01:53:06,404
Criminals, Tony.

1024
01:53:06,404 --> 01:53:09,528
Think that's the word you're looking for.

1025
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,666
<i>Right?</i>

1026
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:15,800
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1027
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:21,161
But here we are. Because you broke the law.
Yeah. I didn't make you.

1028
01:53:21,161 --> 01:53:23,699
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.

1029
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:27,219
La, la, la, la, la...
You're all grown up, you got a wife and kids.

1030
01:53:27,219 --> 01:53:31,340
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before you chose the wrong side?

1031
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:34,434
You got to watch your back with this guy.

1032
01:53:34,434 --> 01:53:37,648
There's a chance he's going to break it.

1033
01:53:38,345 --> 01:53:42,555
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1034
01:53:42,555 --> 01:53:44,511
Who are you?

1035
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,831
Come on, man.

1036
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:52,369
How's Rhodes? They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow, so...

1037
01:53:52,369 --> 01:53:54,130
....fingers crossed.

1038
01:53:54,695 --> 01:53:57,456
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

1039
01:53:58,365 --> 01:54:00,800
You're the good cop, now?

1040
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,802
I am just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1041
01:54:02,802 --> 01:54:04,417
Well, you better go get a bad cop...

1042
01:54:04,417 --> 01:54:08,800
because you're going to have to go Mark Fuhrman
on my ass to get information out of me.

1043
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,949
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1044
01:54:10,949 --> 01:54:14,533
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.

1045
01:54:14,533 --> 01:54:18,140
What'd you do?
Get it back up!

1046
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:20,228
<i>Just look.</i>

1047
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:25,194
Because that is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1048
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:30,283
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong. That's a first.

1049
01:54:30,283 --> 01:54:34,125
Cap is definitely off the reservation but
he's about to need all the help he can get.

1050
01:54:34,125 --> 01:54:39,322
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to... Hey, it's all right.

1051
01:54:46,007 --> 01:54:52,180
Look, I will tell you
but you have to go alone and as a friend.

1052
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:54,610
<i>Easy....</i>

1053
01:54:56,975 --> 01:54:58,475
<i>Stark....?</i>

1054
01:54:58,475 --> 01:55:01,435
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1055
01:55:01,435 --> 01:55:05,649
I am going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.

1056
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:08,872
I will put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1057
01:56:16,587 --> 01:56:20,703
You remember that time we had to ride back from
Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?

1058
01:56:20,703 --> 01:56:24,453
Was that the time we used
our train money to buy hot dogs?

1059
01:56:24,453 --> 01:56:27,994
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1060
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:31,653
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1061
01:56:31,653 --> 01:56:35,411
She's got to be a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.

1062
01:56:44,157 --> 01:56:49,109
He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.

1063
01:57:30,578 --> 01:57:33,746
- You ready?
- Yeah....

1064
01:57:46,243 --> 01:57:49,453
You seem a little defensive.

1065
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:51,650
It's been a long day.

1066
01:57:51,650 --> 01:57:55,853
At ease, Soldier. I am not currently after you.
Then why are you here?

1067
01:57:55,853 --> 01:58:00,773
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.

1068
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,900
Ross has no idea I am here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1069
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:08,090
Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

1070
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:11,454
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.

1071
01:58:13,912 --> 01:58:17,414
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.

1072
01:58:17,414 --> 01:58:22,677
Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...

1073
01:58:41,916 --> 01:58:45,377
<i>I got heat signatures.
How many?</i>

1074
01:58:45,819 --> 01:58:48,680
<i>Uh.......... one.</i>

1075
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:11,118
<i>If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.</i>

1076
01:59:17,167 --> 01:59:20,957
<i>Did you really think
I wanted more of you?</i>

1077
01:59:21,622 --> 01:59:23,733
What the hell?

1078
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:26,814
<i>I am grateful to them, though.</i>

1079
01:59:26,814 --> 01:59:29,353
<i>They brought you here.</i>

1080
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,309
<i>Please, Captain.</i>

1081
01:59:35,309 --> 01:59:39,943
<i>The Soviets built this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.</i>

1082
01:59:39,943 --> 01:59:44,095
<i>I am betting I could beat that.
Oh, I am sure you could, Mr Stark.</i>

1083
01:59:44,095 --> 01:59:48,079
<i>Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.</i>

1084
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:51,234
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1085
01:59:56,632 --> 02:00:01,363
I have thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1086
02:00:01,363 --> 02:00:03,679
I studied you.

1087
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,761
I followed you.

1088
02:00:05,761 --> 02:00:10,385
But now that you're standing here
I just realised.....

1089
02:00:11,355 --> 02:00:15,395
....there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1090
02:00:16,877 --> 02:00:19,738
How nice to find a flaw.

1091
02:00:19,738 --> 02:00:21,912
You're Sokovian.

1092
02:00:22,675 --> 02:00:24,289
Is that what this is about?

1093
02:00:24,289 --> 02:00:29,601
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell. No.

1094
02:00:30,332 --> 02:00:33,693
I am here because I made a promise.

1095
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:38,416
You lost someone?

1096
02:00:41,694 --> 02:00:44,344
<i>I lost everyone.</i>

1097
02:00:45,172 --> 02:00:47,662
And so will you.

1098
02:00:53,055 --> 02:00:57,775
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

1099
02:00:57,775 --> 02:01:00,998
But one which crumbles from within?

1100
02:01:01,922 --> 02:01:03,722
That's dead.

1101
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:06,050
<i>Forever.</i>

1102
02:01:14,193 --> 02:01:16,523
I know that road.

1103
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:19,997
What is this?

1104
02:01:42,072 --> 02:01:48,323
<i>- Help my wife.
- Please..... Help.....</i>

1105
02:01:53,106 --> 02:01:55,186
<i>Sergeant Barnes.....?</i>

1106
02:01:56,143 --> 02:01:57,783
<i>Howard.....</i>

1107
02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:06,708
<i>Howard.....</i>

1108
02:02:43,123 --> 02:02:45,713
<i>No..... Tony.</i>

1109
02:02:54,085 --> 02:02:56,185
Did you know?

1110
02:02:57,497 --> 02:03:02,625
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?

1111
02:03:06,012 --> 02:03:07,662
Yes......

1112
02:04:03,554 --> 02:04:05,493
Get out of here!

1113
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:21,302
It wasn't him, Tony. HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move! It wasn't him!

1114
02:04:29,412 --> 02:04:31,453
<i>Left bootjet failing.</i>

1115
02:04:31,453 --> 02:04:36,460
<i>Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.</i>

1116
02:04:49,225 --> 02:04:51,835
He's not going to stop.
Go.

1117
02:05:13,699 --> 02:05:18,677
Come on, come on. Targeting system's knackered.
Boss. I am eyeballing it.

1118
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:40,984
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.

1119
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:09,432
This isn't going to change what happened.
I don't care. He killed my mom.

1120
02:07:09,756 --> 02:07:17,582
<i>You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay? I am going to bed. I love you.</i>

1121
02:07:25,006 --> 02:07:28,266
I almost killed the wrong man.

1122
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:33,400
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?

1123
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:36,631
To see them rip each other apart.

1124
02:07:39,994 --> 02:07:43,114
My father lived outside the city.

1125
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:46,381
I thought we would be safe there.

1126
02:07:46,381 --> 02:07:52,076
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man from the car window.

1127
02:07:52,382 --> 02:07:55,800
I told my wife, "Don't worry."

1128
02:07:55,800 --> 02:08:00,421
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1129
02:08:01,958 --> 02:08:04,798
When the dust cleared.....

1130
02:08:05,229 --> 02:08:07,908
....and the screaming stopped...

1131
02:08:08,157 --> 02:08:13,077
....it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1132
02:08:14,613 --> 02:08:16,802
My father......

1133
02:08:16,802 --> 02:08:21,582
...still holding my wife and son in his arms.

1134
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,439
And the Avengers?

1135
02:08:28,002 --> 02:08:30,302
They went home.

1136
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:37,591
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.

1137
02:08:37,591 --> 02:08:42,194
<i>But, if I could get them
to kill each other.....</i>

1138
02:08:45,502 --> 02:08:48,773
I am sorry about your father.

1139
02:08:48,773 --> 02:08:51,453
He seemed a good man.

1140
02:08:52,443 --> 02:08:54,943
With a dutiful son.

1141
02:08:58,556 --> 02:09:01,646
Vengeance has consumed you.

1142
02:09:03,145 --> 02:09:05,774
It's consuming them.

1143
02:09:09,301 --> 02:09:12,690
I am done letting it consume me.

1144
02:09:15,009 --> 02:09:18,639
Justice will come soon enough.

1145
02:09:20,871 --> 02:09:23,511
Tell that to the dead.

1146
02:09:27,011 --> 02:09:30,820
The living are not done with you, yet.

1147
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:36,018
<i>You can't beat him hand-to-hand.</i>

1148
02:09:36,018 --> 02:09:40,164
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.....

1149
02:09:43,685 --> 02:09:45,926
<i>Countermeasures ready.....</i>

1150
02:09:46,697 --> 02:09:48,896
Let's kick his ass.

1151
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:05,771
- He's my friend.
- So was I.

1152
02:10:11,713 --> 02:10:14,804
<i>Stay down.
Final warning.</i>

1153
02:10:28,002 --> 02:10:30,891
I could do this all day.

1154
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:39,548
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1155
02:11:40,677 --> 02:11:45,193
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!

1156
02:12:20,006 --> 02:12:25,048
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1157
02:12:26,323 --> 02:12:29,193
Raise your voice, zap.

1158
02:12:29,193 --> 02:12:31,704
Touch the glass, zap.

1159
02:12:31,704 --> 02:12:37,134
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?

1160
02:12:37,743 --> 02:12:40,199
So how does it feel?

1161
02:12:40,199 --> 02:12:50,846
To spend all that time, all that effort
to..... see it fail so spectacularly?

1162
02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:56,001
<i>Did it....?</i>

1163
02:13:20,886 --> 02:13:25,380
It's just the first pass. Yeah.
Give me some feedback, anything you think of.

1164
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:28,359
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1165
02:13:28,585 --> 02:13:33,927
Cup holder?
You may want to think about some AC down in... Ow.

1166
02:13:35,006 --> 02:13:39,262
Let's go. I will give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.

1167
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:43,172
Ah.....

1168
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:56,408
Hundred and thirty eight.

1169
02:13:56,408 --> 02:14:01,189
138 combat missions.
That's how many I have flown, Tony.

1170
02:14:01,189 --> 02:14:04,893
Every one of them
could have been my last, but I flew them.

1171
02:14:05,764 --> 02:14:10,399
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.

1172
02:14:10,399 --> 02:14:14,511
I signed because it was the right thing to do.

1173
02:14:15,666 --> 02:14:18,805
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1174
02:14:19,202 --> 02:14:21,542
This is a bad beat.

1175
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:25,511
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1176
02:14:26,376 --> 02:14:28,345
I don't think.

1177
02:14:38,079 --> 02:14:40,560
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1178
02:14:42,592 --> 02:14:50,533
Are you Tony Stank? Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1179
02:14:50,533 --> 02:14:54,421
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.

1180
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:58,466
"Table for one, Mr Stank."
"Please, by the bathroom."

1181
02:15:04,322 --> 02:15:05,721
<i>Tony.....</i>

1182
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:08,301
<i>I am glad you're back at the compound.</i>

1183
02:15:08,301 --> 02:15:11,618
<i>I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.</i>

1184
02:15:11,618 --> 02:15:13,609
<i>We all need family.</i>

1185
02:15:14,323 --> 02:15:18,663
<i>The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.</i>

1186
02:15:18,953 --> 02:15:22,104
<i>I have been on my own since I was 18.</i>

1187
02:15:22,104 --> 02:15:27,682
<i>I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.</i>

1188
02:15:28,404 --> 02:15:33,902
<i>My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.</i>

1189
02:15:33,902 --> 02:15:39,752
<i>And I am happy to say that, for the most
part they haven't let me down.</i>

1190
02:15:40,551 --> 02:15:44,190
<i>Which is why I can't
let them down either.</i>

1191
02:15:47,015 --> 02:15:51,485
<i>Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.</i>

1192
02:15:52,570 --> 02:15:54,951
<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>

1193
02:15:54,951 --> 02:16:00,564
<i>I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents I was sparing you but...</i>

1194
02:16:00,564 --> 02:16:03,707
<i>....I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.</i>

1195
02:16:03,707 --> 02:16:08,546
<i>And I am sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.</i>

1196
02:16:08,546 --> 02:16:12,536
<i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.</i>

1197
02:16:12,536 --> 02:16:15,841
<i>I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.</i>

1198
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:17,298
<i>That's all any of us should.</i>

1199
02:16:17,298 --> 02:16:22,293
<i>Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.</i>

1200
02:16:22,751 --> 02:16:25,100
Yeah, put him through.

1201
02:16:25,729 --> 02:16:30,391
<i>Tony, we have a problem.
Uh, please hold. No, don't.</i>

1202
02:16:31,926 --> 02:16:34,197
<i>So no matter what.....</i>

1203
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:38,200
<i>I promise you if you need us...</i>

1204
02:16:38,774 --> 02:16:41,034
<i>....if you need me...</i>

1205
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:46,889
<i>I will be there.</i>

1206
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,750
You sure about this?

1207
02:18:48,563 --> 02:18:51,442
I can't trust my own mind.

1208
02:18:53,235 --> 02:18:59,307
So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out
of my head I think going back under is the best thing.

1209
02:18:59,307 --> 02:19:01,457
For everybody.

1210
02:19:23,001 --> 02:19:25,310
Thank you for this.

1211
02:19:26,809 --> 02:19:29,649
Your friend and my father.....

1212
02:19:29,649 --> 02:19:32,452
...they were both victims.

1213
02:19:33,149 --> 02:19:37,190
If I can help one of them find peace...

1214
02:19:39,121 --> 02:19:44,989
You know, if they find out
he's here they will come for him.

1215
02:19:46,163 --> 02:19:48,532
Let them try.

1216
02:23:38,827 --> 02:23:44,247
# Hey, shady baby #
# I am hot like the prodigal son #

1217
02:23:48,413 --> 02:23:50,122
# Pick a petal #
# Eenie, meenie, miney, moe #

1218
02:23:50,122 --> 02:23:53,876
# And flower #
# You're the chosen one #

1219
02:23:56,604 --> 02:24:01,725
# Well, your left hand's free #
# And your right's in a grip #

1220
02:24:01,725 --> 02:24:06,358
# With another left hand #
# Watch his right hand slip #

1221
02:24:06,358 --> 02:24:12,996
# Towards his gun #
# Oh, no #

1222
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:26,480
# I tackle, we tussle #
# Oh, my days, we're rolling #

1223
02:24:30,188 --> 02:24:36,487
# My right hand's gripped on his #
# Colt Single Action Army #

1224
02:24:37,219 --> 02:24:44,111
# Oh, no, well, your left hand's free #
# And your right's in a grip #

1225
02:24:44,111 --> 02:24:48,722
# With another left hand #
# Watch his right hand slip #

1226
02:24:48,722 --> 02:24:54,250

# Oh, no #

1227
02:24:54,250 --> 02:24:59,738
# N-E-O, O-M-G, Gee whiz #
# Girl, you're the one for me #

1228
02:25:03,479 --> 02:25:10,368
# Though your man's bigger than I am #
# Oh, my days, he disagrees #

1229
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:14,757
# Oh, no #
# Speak easy #

1230
02:25:30,815 --> 02:25:35,799
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh #

1231
02:25:35,799 --> 02:25:40,468
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh #

1232
02:25:40,468 --> 02:25:45,799
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh, oh, no #

1233
02:25:45,799 --> 02:25:51,635
# Hey, shady baby #
# I am hot like the prodigal son #

1234
02:25:55,239 --> 02:25:56,979
# Pick a petal #
# Eenie, meenie, miney, moe #

1235
02:25:56,979 --> 02:26:00,835
# And flower #
# You're the chosen one #

1236
02:26:04,048 --> 02:26:08,700
# Well, your left hand's free #
# Oh #

1237
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:13,500
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh #

1238
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:18,100
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh #

1239
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,799

# Oh #

1240
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:29,281
# Well, my left hand's free #
# Oh, oh, no #

1241
02:26:29,281 --> 02:26:33,470
So, who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.

1242
02:26:33,470 --> 02:26:38,275
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name? Uh, Steve.

1243
02:26:38,275 --> 02:26:40,384
Steve? From 12-C?

1244
02:26:40,384 --> 02:26:44,992
With the overbite? No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.

1245
02:26:47,257 --> 02:26:50,000
Ouch.
Well...

1246
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,389
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.

1247
02:26:54,389 --> 02:26:59,132
Okay. His friend was huge.
Like huge.

1248
02:27:00,129 --> 02:27:05,631
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.

1249
02:27:07,504 --> 02:27:11,693
Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?
