1
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,444
Millions of years ago...

2
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:42,277
a meteorite made of vibranium...

3
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,981
the strongest substance
in the universe...

4
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,688
struck the continent of Africa...

5
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,966
affecting the plant life around it.

6
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,040
And when the time of men came...

7
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:56,926
five tribes settled on
it and called it...

8
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:58,807
Wakanda.

9
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:03,722
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other

10
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:05,671
until a warrior shaman

11
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:08,778
received a vision from
the panther goddess Bast

12
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,358
who led him to the
heart-shaped herb.

13
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,953
A plant that granted him
superhuman strength,

14
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,653
speed and instincts.

15
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:20,218
The warrior became king...

16
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,596
and the first Black Panther.

17
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,385
The protector of Wakanda.

18
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,373
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule.

19
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:33,108
But the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,191
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology

21
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,406
more advanced than
any other nation.

22
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,239
But as Wakanda thrived,

23
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,763
the world around it
descended further into chaos.

24
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:51,131
To keep vibranium safe,

25
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:54,564
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

26
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:58,885
keeping the truth of their
power from the outside world.

27
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:18,550
-Lucky shot!
-That ain't lucky!

28
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,143
-Whatever!
-Get outta here!

29
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:22,609
Check up. No dirties.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,335
What?

31
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:26,938
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

32
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,298
Got you, E!

33
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,122
Watch me get this...

34
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,935
Tim Hardaway style. That's
what I call it, baby.

35
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,112
Hey, look, if we get in and out
quick, won't be no worries.

36
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,451
You're in the van, come
in through from the west.

37
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,664
Come around the corner.

38
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,079
-Land right here.
-Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,719
Me and the twins
pullin' up right here.

40
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,050
We're leaving this car behind, okay?
We come this...

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,745
Hide the straps.

42
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,664
Yo, is it the feds?

43
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,557
No.

44
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:24,438
These two Grace Jones
lookin' chicks.

45
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,260
They own spears.

46
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,700
Open it.

47
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:29,598
You serious?

48
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,966
They won't knock again.

49
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,490
Who are you?

50
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,800
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

51
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:57,137
Show me you're one of us.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,689
My King.

53
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:09,762
Leave us.

54
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,935
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays.

55
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,197
With your permission,
King T'Chaka.

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,526
As you wish.

57
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:18,875
At ease.

58
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,720
Come, brother.

59
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,033
Let me see how you're
holding up.

60
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,500
You look strong.

61
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,521
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

62
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,103
How's home?

63
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,783
Not so good.

64
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,581
Little brother.

65
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,538
There has been an attack.

66
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,058
This man...

67
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,658
Ulysses Klaue...

68
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:02,185
stole a quarter ton
of vibranium from us

69
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:04,732
and triggered a bomb at
the border to escape.

70
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,994
Many lives were lost.

71
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,988
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,779
and how to strike.

73
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,625
He had someone on the inside.

74
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:18,600
Why are you here?

75
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:21,968
Because I want you to
look me in the eyes...

76
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:25,214
and tell me why
you betrayed Wakanda.

77
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,766
I did no such thing.

78
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,588
Tell him who you are.

79
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:34,351
Zuri, son of Badu.

80
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,550
What?

81
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,113
James.

82
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,685
James, you lied to me?

83
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,072
-Leave him be.
-I let you into my home...

84
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:46,365
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

85
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,973
-You betrayed Wakanda!
-How can you lie to me?

86
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,110
Stand!

87
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:50,579
Down.

88
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,786
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

89
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,779
Prince N'Jobu,

90
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,922
you will return home at once...

91
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,677
where you will face the Council

92
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:17,435
and inform them of your crimes.

93
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:21,954
Look up!

94
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,468
Guard your man, guard your man!

95
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:19,983
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death</i>

96
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,129
<i>of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

97
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,906
<i>The beloved ruler was one
of many confirmed dead</i>

98
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,776
<i>after a terrorist attack at the
United Nations a week ago.</i>

99
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,632
<i>The suspect has since
been apprehended.</i>

100
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,629
<i>Though it remains one of the
poorest countries in the world,</i>

101
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,584
<i>fortified by mountain ranges</i>

102
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,571
<i>and an impenetrable rain forest,</i>

103
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,745
<i>Wakanda does not engage
in international trade</i>

104
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,254
<i>or accept aid.</i>

105
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:43,735
<i>The succession of the throne</i>

106
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,420
<i>is expected to fall to the oldest
of the king's two children,</i>

107
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,840
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

108
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,526
My prince...

109
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,567
Coming up on them now.

110
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,283
Sambisa Forest, Nigeria

111
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,656
No need, Okoye. I can
handle this alone.

112
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:19,680
Hmm.

113
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:26,728
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

114
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:33,100
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

115
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,922
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,414
I never freeze.

117
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,716
What's going on?

118
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,345
Lost power.

119
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,938
Won't start.

120
00:08:58,549 --> 00:08:59,945
The car not start.

121
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,658
What happened?

122
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,128
The engine's failed.

123
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:05,741
Ours too.

124
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,595
What is it, Captain?

125
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,671
Defense positions.

126
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:23,687
Defense positions.

127
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,543
Are we under attack?

128
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,190
Defense positions.

129
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,100
N'jou! Get around to the side.

130
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,600
Defense positions.

131
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,177
Hey! Defense positions!

132
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,139
No games.

133
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,922
What do you see?

134
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,753
Come in. Come in.

135
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:15,047
-Over there!
-Look back!

136
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,566
Watch out!

137
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:43,813
T'Challa, no!

138
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:45,474
This one's just a boy.

139
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,280
He got kidnapped as well.

140
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:50,534
Nakia...

141
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,860
I...

142
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,490
-I wanted...
-Hey!

143
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,399
I have her! Don't move!
I will shoot!

144
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,442
I will shoot her right--

145
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:12,481
You froze.

146
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,701
Ah.

147
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:20,264
Why are you here?
You ruined my mission.

148
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,840
My father is dead, Nakia.

149
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:27,099
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

150
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,761
And I wish for you
to be there.

151
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,345
Carry yourselves home now.

152
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:42,202
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

153
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,607
Thank you.

154
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,691
You will speak
nothing of this day.

155
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,066
Yes.

156
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:55,965
Thank you.

157
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:57,822
Thank you.

158
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,691
Sister Nakia...

159
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,640
my Prince...

160
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,996
we are in home.

161
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,519
This never gets old.

162
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:10,589
Queen Mother...

163
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,344
Princess...

164
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,472
A comfort for your loss.

165
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,861
Thank you, Nakia.

166
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:19,058
It is so good to have
you back with us.

167
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:22,221
Take her to the River Province
to prepare her for the ceremony.

168
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,364
Yes, General.

169
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,270
Did he freeze?

170
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,399
Like an antelope in headlights.

171
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,277
You finished?

172
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,861
So surprised my little
sister came to see me off

173
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,544
before our big day.

174
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:48,352
You wish.

175
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:51,097
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

176
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,667
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

177
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,047
How many times do
I have to teach you?

178
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,770
Just because something works

179
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:58,522
doesn't mean that
it cannot be improved.

180
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:01,476
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

181
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:02,745
More than you.

182
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:06,061
I can't wait to see what
kind of update you make

183
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,301
to your ceremonial outfit.

184
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:10,787
Shuri!

185
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,557
Sorry, Mother!

186
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:15,110
How are you feeling today,
Mother?

187
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:16,496
Proud.

188
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:21,129
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

189
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,813
He is with us...

190
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,115
and it is your time to be king.

191
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:33,989
London, United Kingdom

192
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:47,959
Good Morning.

193
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,479
How can I help you?

194
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:52,365
Oh, just checking out
these artifacts.

195
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,754
They tell me you're the expert.

196
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,042
Ah, you  could say that.

197
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:58,953
They're beautiful.

198
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,495
Where is this one from?

199
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,275
The Bobo Ashanti tribe.

200
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,770
Present day Ghana,
nineteenth century.

201
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:08,080
For real?

202
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:10,928
And what about this one?

203
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,264
That one's from the
Edo people of Benin,

204
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,739
sixteenth century.

205
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,860
Now, tell me about this one.

206
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,028
Also from Benin, seventh century.

207
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,466
Fula tribe, I believe.

208
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,390
Nah.

209
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,360
I beg your pardon?

210
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,322
It was taken by British
soldiers in Benin,

211
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,822
but it's from Wakanda.

212
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,809
And it's made out of vibranium.

213
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,677
Don't trip. I'ma take it
off your hands for you.

214
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,100
These items aren't for sale.

215
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,899
How do you think your
ancestors got these?

216
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:51,442
You think they
paid a fair price?

217
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,096
Or did they take it, like
they took everything else?

218
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,476
Sir, I'm going to have to...
ask you to leave.

219
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,892
You got all this security in here
watching me ever since I walked in.

220
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,529
But you ain't checking for
what you put in your body.

221
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:06,601
All right, mate, let's have it
Come on, mate, time.

222
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,015
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

223
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,289
Hey! Somebody get some help!
Come here!

224
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,733
Call the doctor, please!

225
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:13,980
Hey, please, somebody come help!

226
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,001
Medical emergency
right away in the

227
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,074
West African exhibit,
please, right away.

228
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,174
Watch out.

229
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,525
Step back, please. Step back.

230
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,201
Ho! Medics coming.

231
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,153
I'm gonna take a break.

232
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:31,718
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

233
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:34,226
Step back, please, gents.
Step back, please.

234
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,788
Hey, come here.

235
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,462
Come here, come here.

236
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:42,853
It's okay.

237
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:46,927
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

238
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:54,759
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

239
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,630
Because it's better to leave the
crime scene more spread out.

240
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,357
Makes it look like amateurs.

241
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:19,191
Now then, let's see if you know
what you're talking about.

242
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,057
That's just a taste.

243
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:47,106
-You're gonna be rich, boy.
-You better sell that quick.

244
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,595
It's already sold.

245
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,251
Whatever you try, the Wakandans
will probably show up.

246
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,839
Well, that'll make my day.

247
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,413
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

248
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:58,951
You're not telling me
that's vibranium too?

249
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,828
Nah, I'm just feelin' it.

250
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,480
Ahead!

251
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:44,880
Ahead!

252
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,916
I, Zuri,

253
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,807
son of Badu...

254
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,617
give to you...

255
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,851
Prince T'Challa...

256
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,007
The Black Panther!

257
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,249
The Prince...

258
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:23,989
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther

259
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,449
stripped away.

260
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:00,227
Glory to the ancestors.

261
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,673
Glory to the ancestors.

262
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:05,949
Victory in ritual combat...

263
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:09,836
comes by yield or death.

264
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,444
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior,

265
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:15,777
I now offer...

266
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,026
a path to the throne.

267
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:27,606
The Merchant Tribe will
not challenge today.

268
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:33,368
The Border Tribe will
not challenge today.

269
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,188
The River Tribe will
not challenge today.

270
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,032
The Mining Tribe will
not challenge today.

271
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:47,805
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

272
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:51,519
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

273
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,865
This corset is really
uncomfortable.

274
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:01,209
So, could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

275
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,901
Mother!

276
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,746
Hey.

277
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,133
-Are they Jabari?
-Yes.

278
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:41,780
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,630
It's challenge day.

280
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,825
We have watched...

281
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,642
and listened from the mountains!

282
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,846
We have watched with disgust,

283
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:00,813
as your technological
advancements

284
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,391
have been overseen by a child!

285
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,775
Who scoffs at tradition!

286
00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:14,946
And now you want to hand the
nation over to this prince...

287
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:20,648
who could not keep
his own father safe.

288
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,119
Hmm?

289
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,317
We will not have it.

290
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:31,535
I say, we will not have it!

291
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,238
I, M'Baku...

292
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,595
leader of the Jabari...

293
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:41,992
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

294
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:45,202
Glory to Hanuman.

295
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:04,557
Jabari!

296
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,444
Dora Milaje!

297
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:08,778
Ahead!

298
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:18,392
Let the challenge begin!

299
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:30,913
Oh!

300
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:35,041
Stand up!

301
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:45,828
Come!

302
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,915
T'Challa!

303
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,548
Where is your god now?

304
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:13,247
Hey!

305
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,278
Yes!

306
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:23,728
No powers!

307
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:25,351
No claws!

308
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,492
No special suit!

309
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:31,566
Just a boy, not fit to lead!

310
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,819
Show him who you are!

311
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,124
I am Prince T'Challa!

312
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:55,134
Son of King T'Chaka!

313
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,729
You can do this, T'Challa!

314
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:11,373
Yes!

315
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:12,915
Come on!

316
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,217
Yield! Don't make me kill you!

317
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,083
I would rather die!

318
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:21,348
T'Challa!

319
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:23,538
T'Challa!

320
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:25,356
T'Challa!

321
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:27,784
T'Challa!

322
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:29,550
T'Challa!

323
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:30,933
You have fought with honor!

324
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,113
Now yield!

325
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,439
Your people need you.

326
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:35,748
T'Challa!

327
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:36,892
Yield, man!

328
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,260
T'Challa!

329
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,261
T'Challa!

330
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:42,877
Yes!

331
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:44,481
Yes!

332
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:52,952
He-he-hey!

333
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:08,211
I now present to you,

334
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,088
King T'Challa!

335
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,244
The Black Panther.

336
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:22,526
Zuri.

337
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,512
My King.

338
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:36,807
Wakanda forever!

339
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,131
Wakanda forever!

340
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:13,471
Allow the heart-shaped herb

341
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,963
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

342
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:20,579
and take the Ancestral Plane.

343
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:25,258
T'Chaka...

344
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:28,345
we call on you.

345
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,290
Come here to your son.

346
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,609
Glory to the ancestors.

347
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:16,009
Father.

348
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,500
My son.

349
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,439
I am sorry.

350
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,604
Stand up.

351
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,829
You are a king.

352
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,641
What's wrong, son?

353
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:52,335
I am not ready.

354
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,626
Have you not prepared...

355
00:31:55,797 --> 00:32:00,063
your whole life to be king?

356
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:03,661
Have you not trained
and studied...

357
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,781
always by my side?

358
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:11,501
That is not what
I am talking about.

359
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:18,153
I am not ready to be without you.

360
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,111
A man who has not prepared
his children for his own death

361
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,384
has failed as a father.

362
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:29,480
Have I ever failed you?

363
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,121
Never.

364
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:39,739
Tell me how to best
protect Wakanda.

365
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:44,154
I want to be a great king, Baba.

366
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,176
Just like you.

367
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,563
You're going to struggle.

368
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:53,567
So you'll need to surround
yourself with people you trust.

369
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:55,528
You're a good man

370
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:57,624
with a good heart.

371
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:01,029
And it's hard for a good man
to be king.

372
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,250
Breathe.

373
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,191
T'Challa, breathe.

374
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,163
Breathe.

375
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,721
He was there.

376
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,862
He was there.

377
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:19,750
My father.

378
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,602
Just one.

379
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:45,145
Come home, Nakia.

380
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:46,411
I'm right here.

381
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,703
Stay.

382
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,679
I came to support you

383
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,186
and to honor your father.

384
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:53,877
But I can't stay.

385
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,932
It's just, I found my
calling out there.

386
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:01,355
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

387
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,211
I can't be happy here

388
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:06,640
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

389
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:10,608
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

390
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:12,340
Share what we have.

391
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,835
We could provide aid
and access to technology

392
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,184
and refuge to those who need it.

393
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,702
Other countries do it,
we could it do better.

394
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:24,000
We are not alike,
these countries, Nakia.

395
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,226
If the world found out
what we truly are...

396
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:28,594
what we possess,

397
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,298
we could lose our way of life.

398
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:32,693
Wakanda is strong
enough to help others

399
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,956
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

400
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:39,677
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

401
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:42,311
I would make a great queen
<i>because</i> I am so stubborn.

402
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:45,552
-Ah, see, you admit it!
-If...if that's what I wanted.

403
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:54,501
Is that him?

404
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,672
Hoo!

405
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,420
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

406
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,161
Of course.

407
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,114
I see Nakia is back.

408
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,550
You guys going to work it out?

409
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:15,498
T'Challa...

410
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:17,202
What's wrong?

411
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:19,346
Nakia thinks we
should be doing more.

412
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,427
More like what?

413
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,103
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

414
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:25,173
You let the refugees in,

415
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:27,351
they bring their
problems with them.

416
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,981
And then Wakanda is
like everywhere else.

417
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:35,195
Now if you said you
wanted me and my men...

418
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:39,038
to go out there and clean out
the world, then I'll be all for it.

419
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:43,170
But waging war on other countries
has never been our way.

420
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:48,688
You too, huh?

421
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,768
Bast! We're in trouble.

422
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:54,818
My King.

423
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:56,949
My love.

424
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,786
You will never guess who
just popped up on our radar.

425
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:05,804
A misidentified Wakandan artifact

426
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:09,043
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

427
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:13,231
We have learned Ulysses Klaue

428
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,170
plans to sell the vibranium

429
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,376
to an American buyer
in South Korea

430
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:18,920
tomorrow night.

431
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:25,128
Klaue has escaped our
pursuits for almost 30 years.

432
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:29,400
Not capturing him is perhaps
my father's greatest regret.

433
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,349
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

434
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:37,454
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

435
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:38,871
We need a king.

436
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:41,722
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

437
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,871
Not a day goes by when
I do not think about

438
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,739
what Klaue took from us.

439
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,221
From me.

440
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:52,117
It's too great an
opportunity to pass.

441
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:53,266
Take me with you.

442
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,536
We'll take him down
together side by side.

443
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:58,686
I need you here
protecting the border.

444
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,204
Then I ask...

445
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,436
do you kill him
where he stands...

446
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,842
or you bring him back to us?

447
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,139
You have my word.

448
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,780
I will bring him back.

449
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,324
We will proceed with the mission.

450
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:01,452
My King!

451
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,485
Stop it. Stop it.

452
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,798
I've already sent a car
ahead to Busan for you.

453
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,126
Who are you taking
with you to Korea?

454
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:12,807
Okoye.

455
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:15,090
And Nakia as well.

456
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:20,873
You sure it's a good idea to
take your ex on a mission?

457
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,309
Yes.

458
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,711
We'll be fine. Besides, you'll be
on call should we need backup.

459
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:27,612
Yes!

460
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,135
I have great things
to show you, brother.

461
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:33,423
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

462
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:38,311
Unlimited range, also equipped
with audio surveillance system.

463
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,882
Check these out.

464
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:44,128
Remote access Kimoyo beads.

465
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:47,222
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

466
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:48,208
Ah.

467
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:51,050
And what are these?

468
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,248
The real question is
what are those?!

469
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,494
Why do you have your
toes out in my lab?

470
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:58,764
What? You don't like
my royal sandals?

471
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:01,728
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

472
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:03,927
Yeah, I bet the elders loved it.

473
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,896
Try them on.

474
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,481
Fully automated.

475
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:14,070
Like the old American
movie Baba used to watch.

476
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,777
Mmm.

477
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:17,635
And I made them completely
sound absorbent.

478
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:20,369
Interesting.

479
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:21,871
Guess what I call them.

480
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:23,760
Sneakers.

481
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:26,570
Because you...

482
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,025
Never mind.

483
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:30,771
If you're going to
take on Klaue,

484
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:34,972
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

485
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:36,634
Exhibit A.

486
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:38,443
-My design.
-Old tech.

487
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:40,905
-Old?
-Functional, but old.

488
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:44,876
"Hey, people are shooting me.
Wait, let me put on my helmet."

489
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,282
Enough.

490
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,724
Now, look at these.

491
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,139
Do you like that one?

492
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:54,646
Tempting.

493
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:57,994
But the idea is
to not be noticed.

494
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:01,565
This one.

495
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,394
Now tell it to go on.

496
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:16,110
Whoo!

497
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:20,318
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

498
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,275
Strike it.

499
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:24,891
-Anywhere?
-Mm-hmm.

500
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:29,795
Not that hard, genius!

501
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:32,489
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

502
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:35,485
I invite you to my lab, and
you just kick things around?

503
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,835
Well, maybe you should
make it a little stronger.

504
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,132
Hey...

505
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,804
Wait a minute.

506
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,442
The nanites absorb
the kinetic energy

507
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:46,172
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

508
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,818
Very nice.

509
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:50,759
Strike it again
in the same spot.

510
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,742
You're recording?

511
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,385
For research purposes.

512
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,963
Delete that footage.

513
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:10,070
Busan, South Korea

514
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:27,371
This way.

515
00:41:30,394 --> 00:41:31,889
Bast willing, this will go quickly

516
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,987
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

517
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:38,623
It looks nice. Just
whip it back and forth.

518
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:41,385
What? It's a disgrace.

519
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:44,873
Hello, Sophia.

520
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:47,336
Nice to see you.

521
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:50,204
Who are those two?

522
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:55,079
My friends from Kenya.
Very wealthy. They're good.

523
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,889
Good for causing trouble...

524
00:41:58,085 --> 00:41:59,626
like you?

525
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,972
Thank you.

526
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,041
Spread out.

527
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:36,873
The buyer is likely
already here.

The woman outside.

533
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:59,518
What "trouble" was
she referring to?

534
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,117
Ah. I got into a disagreement
with some ivory traders.

535
00:43:04,271 --> 00:43:06,420
-Made a bit of a mess.
-Hm.

536
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:10,692
And will there be any trouble
tonight, Miss Kenyan Heiress?

537
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,960
It depends...

538
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:14,231
on how quickly
we finish the mission.

539
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:16,585
Can we please focus?

540
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:19,344
Thank you.

541
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:21,768
Here.

542
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:24,436
Glass of whiskey.

543
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:36,398
Eyes up.

544
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,264
Americans.

545
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:43,108
I count three.

546
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,161
Five.

547
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:48,942
How could you miss Grease
Lightning there behind you?

548
00:43:49,112 --> 00:43:50,159
Six.

549
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:53,820
I just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

550
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:56,514
It just got a little
more complicated.

551
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,173
Agent Ross.

552
00:44:01,273 --> 00:44:02,380
Your Highness.

553
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,967
You are buying from Klaue?

554
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,231
What I'm doing or not doing

555
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,943
on behalf of the U.S. government
is none of your concern.

556
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,818
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

557
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,956
Do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

558
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:16,552
I gave you Zemo.

559
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,019
Didn't I keep it under wraps?

560
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:19,809
That the king of the
third world country

561
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,865
runs around in a
bulletproof cat suit?

562
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:23,398
I'd say we were even.

563
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:25,518
You really need to leave, now.

564
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:29,559
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

565
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:31,871
You've been warned.

566
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:34,934
Three, craps.

567
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,632
Hey, you won!

568
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:39,505
You know what?

569
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:41,860
I think I'll just take these,

570
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:43,590
bring 'em over here

571
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:46,351
-and hold on for safekeeping.
-Mm-hmm.

572
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:51,597
Okay, heads up.
The King of Wakanda is here.

573
00:44:51,795 --> 00:44:53,532
He cannot leave with Klaue.

574
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:56,101
All right.

575
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:59,000
Vibranium from the attack on
Sokovia links back to a person

576
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:01,795
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make a deal with.

577
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,568
But that deal will
not be called off.

578
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:05,014
When the dust settles,

579
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,657
you and me can work
something out.

580
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:08,708
I'm not here to make a deal.

581
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,775
Klaue, plus eight.

582
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:38,978
General.

583
00:45:39,117 --> 00:45:41,137
In position to secure our exit.

584
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:42,170
And the vibranium?

585
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:43,844
I don't see it yet.

586
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,715
I thought there were no
weapons allowed in here.

587
00:45:46,905 --> 00:45:48,523
There's not supposed to be.

588
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:51,134
Somebody did not get the memo.

589
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:53,739
Definitely armed.

590
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:56,418
Well, that is quite the entourage.

591
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:57,724
You got a mix tape coming out?

592
00:45:57,909 --> 00:46:00,494
Uh, yeah, yeah,
actually, there is one.

593
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,632
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

594
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,005
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the...?

595
00:46:04,112 --> 00:46:06,128
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

596
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,985
I just meant you got
a lot of people with you.

597
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,751
You think they're for you?

598
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:12,427
Do not worry.

599
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:16,014
I can do a deal with you all by
myself, thank you very much.

600
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:25,663
Six more. It's a set up.

601
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:28,278
You got the diamonds?

602
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:30,503
I think that's enough.

603
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,226
-We need to move on Klaue.
-Stand down.

604
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,992
We can't afford a shootout.

605
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,208
Vibranium?

606
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,335
Well, I was going to buy a
fancy suitcase, but I...

607
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,286
thought I'd save
myself some money.

608
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:54,333
It's now or never.

609
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,601
Don't!

610
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:57,329
Hey!

611
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:01,179
I've been made.

612
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:12,681
Wakandans! They're here!

613
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:16,253
-Get out of here!
-Kill them all!

614
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,525
Diamonds, quick!

615
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:17,391
Assassin!

616
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:23,420
You know,

617
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:26,193
you look just like your old man.

618
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,179
I made it rain!

619
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,735
Let's get out of here, boss!

620
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:45,090
That was awesome!

621
00:48:45,393 --> 00:48:46,574
It was awesome!

622
00:48:46,702 --> 00:48:48,746
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

623
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,528
-Do we just leave him?
-He'll catch up.

624
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:02,985
Shuri!

625
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:07,679
Yes! Yes! Yes!

626
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:10,125
<i>Remote driving system activated.</i>

627
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,646
Wait! Which side
of the road is it?

628
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:14,362
For Bast's sake, just drive!

629
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:15,559
Okay, calm down.

630
00:49:23,532 --> 00:49:25,182
Whoo! Let's go!

631
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:28,050
Put some music on. What do
you think this is, a funeral?

632
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,972
What one is he in now?

633
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:36,420
Hey, split up!

634
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:39,947
-They're trying to lose us.
-I'll take the right.

635
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:44,668
We'll take the other two.
I see a shortcut.

636
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,070
I'm not going to make it!

637
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,570
Keep going!

638
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:12,757
Oh! Brother!

639
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:23,697
Hey, what was that?

640
00:50:23,907 --> 00:50:25,786
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

641
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:38,425
Guns.

642
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:40,909
So primitive.

643
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:42,880
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

644
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,570
The bullets won't penetrate!

645
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:47,460
What are you doing?

646
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:48,715
Just drive.

647
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:54,193
Jeesh!

648
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,157
Whoo!

649
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:07,257
Oh, shit!

♪ Opps on the radar ♪

651
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:21,876
Hey, look at your suit.

652
00:51:22,132 --> 00:51:25,143
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up with kinetic energy.

653
00:51:27,023 --> 00:51:28,358
Pull around the truck.

654
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,202
Where'd he go?

655
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,025
You show off!

656
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,302
There he is!

657
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:50,737
Hold tight!

658
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:55,733
All right, let's have some fun.

659
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:24,911
Hop in.

660
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,789
Put that spear in the trunk.

661
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:34,143
Faster, Shuri.

662
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:35,911
I'm going as fast as I can!

663
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,887
Take a right! Take a right!

Klaue!

667
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,110
Did you think we would forget?

668
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:27,409
Look at me, murderer!

669
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:29,719
Where did you get this weapon?

670
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:32,599
Your savages didn't deserve it.

671
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:38,722
Oh, mercy, King! Mercy!

672
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:40,992
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

673
00:53:41,103 --> 00:53:42,268
King!

674
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:44,771
The world is watching.

675
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:46,847
Come on, guys. Let's go, huh?

676
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,025
Yeah.

677
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,632
Hello!

678
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:15,581
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

679
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:25,364
So, this a big mess, huh?

680
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,871
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

681
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,347
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in...

682
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,047
We cannot talk to Klaue alone.

683
00:54:36,188 --> 00:54:42,007
I prefer to talk to Klaue alone for
5 minutes to make a fuss here.

684
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,581
After your questioning, we will
take him back to Wakanda with us.

685
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,277
What? No. Look, I like you a lot.

686
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,347
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

687
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:55,811
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor
by letting you even be in here.

688
00:54:58,135 --> 00:55:00,554
If touch you again,

689
00:55:00,681 --> 00:55:03,282
I'll stick it to your desktop.

690
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:05,909
Does she speak English?

691
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:07,815
When she wants to.

692
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:09,701
Huh.

693
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,083
I'm going in. And when I'm
done, you guys are up

694
00:55:13,338 --> 00:55:15,099
-Agent Ross.
-Yeah?

695
00:55:15,626 --> 00:55:18,490
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

696
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:20,213
You see that.

697
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:22,139
It's called diplomacy.

698
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,407
You're welcome.

699
00:55:26,452 --> 00:55:27,648
-Okoye.
-Ah.

700
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,639
Play nice.

701
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:30,940
Americans.

702
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:32,989
♪ Don't hurt me ♪

703
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:34,507

704
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,273

706
00:55:38,744 --> 00:55:40,166
Don't hurt me.

707
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:41,659
No more.

708
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:44,978
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

709
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:46,425
I'm much more your speed.

710
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,288
I don't trust anybody,
not in this work.

711
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:51,065
But I am interested in is
that arm cannon out there.

712
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:52,143
Where'd you get that?

713
00:55:52,206 --> 00:55:54,246
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

714
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,588
But I can, uh, get you one if you like.

715
00:55:56,715 --> 00:55:59,858
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier and I'll ask them?

716
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:01,440
He's right outside.

717
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:03,244
Why don't you ask him yourself?

718
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:04,710
What? T'Challa?

719
00:56:05,146 --> 00:56:08,574
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

720
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:09,871
Bingo.

721
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:13,947
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

722
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,291
Um...

723
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:18,579
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

724
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:19,994
<i>It's all a front.</i>

725
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:23,070
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

726
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,905
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

727
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,141
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America,</i>

728
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:28,903
<i>but it was in</i>

729
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:31,418
Africa the whole time.

730
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,353
A technological marvel.

731
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:35,226
All because it was built

732
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:38,172
on a mound of the most
valuable metal known to man.

733
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:41,253
Isipho, they called it. The gift.

734
00:56:41,905 --> 00:56:43,052
Vibranium.

735
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,313
Vibranium, yeah, strongest
metal on Earth.

736
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,724
It's not just a metal.

737
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,047
They sew it into their clothes.

738
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:52,137
It powers their city, their tech...

739
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:53,954
their weapons.

740
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:55,561
Weapons?

741
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:59,190
Yeah. Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

742
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:02,657
That's a nice fairy tale, but
Wakanda is a third world country

743
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,356
and you stole all
their vibranium.

744
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:06,844
I stole...?

745
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:11,365
All of it?

746
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,393
I took a tiny <i>piece</i> of it.

747
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:17,293
They have a mountain full of it.

748
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:19,597
<i>They've been mining it for
thousands of years...</i>

749
00:57:19,688 --> 00:57:21,905
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

750
00:57:22,056 --> 00:57:24,184
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it

751
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:25,907
and got out of there alive.

752
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:28,451
If you don't believe me,
you ask

753
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:31,152
your friend what his
suit is made of.

754
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:33,599
What his claws are made of.

755
00:57:56,728 --> 00:57:58,824
Your father told the UN

756
00:57:58,918 --> 00:58:01,190
that Klaue stole all
vibranium you had.

757
00:58:01,286 --> 00:58:03,199
But now, he telling
me you have more?

758
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:07,483
And do you believe the word of an
arms dealer strapped to a chair?

759
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:26,733
Where is this?

760
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,668
Behind.

761
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:43,547
How much more are you hiding?

762
00:58:44,795 --> 00:58:46,574
Something is happening here behind.

763
00:58:52,934 --> 00:58:53,934
Get down!

764
00:58:57,922 --> 00:58:58,746
Whoo!

765
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,010
Get down!

766
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,306
Cover!

767
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:10,978
I see you took your
time, didn't you?

768
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,853
Nakia.

769
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:42,485
He just jumped in front of me.

770
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:48,518
I don't think he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.

771
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:52,871
Give me a Kimoyo bead.

772
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:59,063
This will stabilize him for now.

773
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,586
Give him to us.

774
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:10,989
We can save him.

775
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,594
Our mission was
to bring back Klaue.

776
01:00:23,407 --> 01:00:24,686
We failed.

777
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:28,291
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

778
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,983
How do we justify bringing
him into our borders?

779
01:00:31,054 --> 01:00:32,530
He took a bullet for me.

780
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:34,429
That was his choice.

781
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:36,931
So now we are just
supposed to let him die?

782
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:39,114
Let us consider that we heal him.

783
01:00:39,563 --> 01:00:42,746
It is his duty to report
back to his country.

784
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:45,615
And as king, it is your
duty to protect ours.

785
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,134
I am well aware of
my duties, General.

786
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:51,835
I cannot just let him die...

787
01:00:52,472 --> 01:00:54,644
knowing we can save him.

788
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,253
Where exactly are we taking him?

789
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:07,865
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

790
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,976
It's going to be fun.

791
01:01:16,976 --> 01:01:18,315
He will live.

792
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:23,976
W'Kabi is here.

793
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,643
What's going on brother, huh?
Where is Klaue?

794
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:37,510
He's not here.

795
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,684
He slipped through our hands.

796
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,507
"Slipped"?

797
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:52,173
For 30 years your father was
in power and did nothing.

798
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,563
With you, I thought
it would be different.

799
01:01:55,606 --> 01:01:57,371
But it's more of the same.

800
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,885
Let's get going, boss.

801
01:02:20,543 --> 01:02:22,300
Do you always sell to the CIA?

802
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,378
I sell to the highest bidder.

803
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,998
But don't you worry. When
I get back to Joburg,

804
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:28,070
and I lay low for a bit,

805
01:02:28,181 --> 01:02:29,911
I'll make sure both
of you guys get paid.

806
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:31,483
I'm not even worried
about the money, bro.

807
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,778
I know you're good for it.

808
01:02:32,826 --> 01:02:35,382
On our way back, just
drop us off in Wakanda.

809
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,492
-You don't want to go there, boy.
-Yeah, I do.

810
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:41,737
Drop it!

811
01:02:42,014 --> 01:02:45,471
Or your little Bonnie and
Clyde routine ends today.

812
01:02:45,577 --> 01:02:47,001
Put your gun down now!

813
01:02:47,335 --> 01:02:48,853
I'm sorry.

814
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,221
-I'm sorry, Erik.
-It's gon' be okay.

815
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:19,847
You...

816
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:22,063
You really want
to go to Wakanda?

817
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,617
They're savages.

818
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:28,742
This is what they do
to people like us.

819
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:30,139
I ain't worried about no brandin'.

820
01:03:30,257 --> 01:03:31,574
Check these out.

821
01:03:32,903 --> 01:03:34,382
Each one is for a kill.

822
01:03:34,836 --> 01:03:37,476
You can scar yourself
as much as you like.

823
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:40,525
To them, you'll just
be an outsider.

824
01:03:40,605 --> 01:03:43,280
You're crazy to think that
you could walk in there.

825
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:52,947
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

826
01:04:07,065 --> 01:04:08,309
Leave us!

827
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:22,706
So your mission
did not go as planned.

828
01:04:23,889 --> 01:04:27,547
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

829
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,989
My father told me
he disappeared.

830
01:04:32,012 --> 01:04:33,639
There was a man today...

831
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:38,396
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

832
01:04:39,887 --> 01:04:42,039
That is not possible.

833
01:04:42,557 --> 01:04:45,980
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

834
01:04:46,074 --> 01:04:48,235
My grandfather's ring!

835
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:51,414
Do not tell me what is possible.
Tell me the truth!

836
01:04:55,945 --> 01:04:57,510
Some truths...

837
01:05:00,315 --> 01:05:03,958
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

838
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,338
That is not your choice to make.

839
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:09,389
What happened to him?

840
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:11,010
I promised the King
to say nothing.

841
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:12,880
I am your king now!

842
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:31,248
Your uncle took...

843
01:05:31,985 --> 01:05:36,050
a war dog assignment in America.

844
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:40,172
Your father...

845
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,786
placed me there...

846
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,954
to observe.

847
01:05:45,956 --> 01:05:47,989
Unbeknownst to him,

848
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:51,150
your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

849
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,489
They had a child.

850
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:57,228
The hardships he saw there...

851
01:05:57,947 --> 01:06:00,081
radicalized your uncle.

852
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,148
I observed for
as long as I could.

853
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:05,293
Their leaders have
been assassinated.

854
01:06:05,409 --> 01:06:07,849
Communities flooded
with drugs and weapons.

855
01:06:08,018 --> 01:06:10,925
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

856
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:13,590
All over the planet,
our people suffer

857
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,646
because they don't have
the tools to fight back.

858
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:20,295
With vibranium weapons, they
could overthrow every country

859
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,449
and Wakanda could rule them all
the right way.

860
01:06:23,592 --> 01:06:27,628
He knew your father
would not support this.

861
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:31,233
So your uncle betrayed us.

862
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:32,329
No.

863
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,132
He helped Klaue steal
the vibranium.

864
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:38,876
No, no, no, no.

865
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:40,742
You will return home at once

866
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:42,610
where you will face the Council

867
01:06:42,744 --> 01:06:45,690
and inform them or your crimes.

868
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,652
He drew his weapon on me.

869
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:48,559
No!

870
01:06:48,956 --> 01:06:49,909
No!

871
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:08,887
Your father killed
his own brother...

872
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:12,927
to save my life.

873
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:19,960
Speak nothing of this.

874
01:07:24,262 --> 01:07:25,804
And the child?

875
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,114
We left him.

876
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,081
We had to...

877
01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:43,202
maintain...

878
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:45,846
the lie.

879
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:12,612
What is this?

880
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:14,599
Just a little gift.

881
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:38,909
Who you are?

882
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,409
All right, where am I?

883
01:09:30,944 --> 01:09:33,087
Don't scare me like
that, colonizer!

884
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,536
Col--what? My name is Everett.

885
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,189
Yes, I know.

886
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:41,805
Everett Ross, former Air Force
pilot and now CIA.

887
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:43,351
Right.

888
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:49,529
Okay, is this Wakanda?

889
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:51,251
No, it's Kansas.

890
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:56,055
How long ago was Korea?

891
01:09:56,188 --> 01:09:57,253
Yesterday.

892
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,293
I don't think so.

893
01:09:58,342 --> 01:10:00,969
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

894
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:03,237
They do here.

895
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:06,634
But not by magic, by technology.

896
01:10:10,788 --> 01:10:14,256
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

897
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:40,372
These train things...

898
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:42,819
that's magnetic levitation, right?

899
01:10:43,067 --> 01:10:44,067
Obviously.

900
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:48,677
Obviously, but I-I never
seen it this...efficient.

901
01:10:50,878 --> 01:10:52,458
The light panels, what are they?

902
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:54,899
-Sonic stabilizers.
-Sonic what?

903
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:56,561
In its raw form,

904
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:59,829
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported at that speed

905
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:03,552
so I... I developed a way to
temporarily deactivate it.

906
01:11:04,496 --> 01:11:06,082
There's vibranium
on those trains?

907
01:11:06,255 --> 01:11:08,703
There's vibranium all around us.

908
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,849
That's how I healed you.

909
01:11:19,935 --> 01:11:21,365
Where is T'Challa?

910
01:11:21,429 --> 01:11:23,555
His Kimoyo beads
have been switched off.

911
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:25,904
Well, we are not joined
at the hip, Okoye.

912
01:11:25,957 --> 01:11:28,895
A man showed up at the border
who claims to have killed Klaue.

913
01:11:29,014 --> 01:11:29,822
What?

914
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:32,243
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

915
01:11:32,283 --> 01:11:34,520
We need to find your brother.

916
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:35,801
An outsider?

917
01:11:35,864 --> 01:11:37,467
No, a Wakandan.

918
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:39,310
He's not a Wakandan.

919
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:43,179
He's one of ours.

920
01:11:55,908 --> 01:11:57,980
He killed his own brother...

921
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:00,324
and left a child behind...

922
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:01,824
with nothing.

923
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:05,500
What kind of king...?

924
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:09,295
What kind of man does that?

925
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:11,689
No man is perfect.

926
01:12:12,488 --> 01:12:13,858
Not even your father.

927
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:17,284
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

928
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,743
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

929
01:12:23,127 --> 01:12:25,518
He may have created
something even worse.

930
01:12:25,658 --> 01:12:26,658
Hey.

931
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,716
Look at me.

932
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:36,715
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

933
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:43,546
<i>You</i> get to decide what kind
of king you are going to be.

934
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,655
Brother, you need
to get here now!

935
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,431
Erik Stevens.

936
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:56,025
Graduated Annapolis, age 19

937
01:12:56,113 --> 01:12:58,042
MIT for grad school.

938
01:12:58,194 --> 01:13:00,520
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan

939
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:03,569
where he racked up confirmed
kills like it was a video game.

940
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:05,398
Started calling him Killmonger.

941
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:08,475
He joined JSOC ghost unit.
Now, these guys are serious.

942
01:13:08,563 --> 01:13:09,841
They will drop off the grid

943
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:13,024
so they can commit assassinations
and take down governments.

944
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,622
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

945
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:18,926
He has a war dog tattoo,

946
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:21,729
but we have no record of him.

947
01:13:28,023 --> 01:13:30,319
Is this man Wakandan or not?

948
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:32,930
Tell us what happens.

949
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:53,597
Speak.

950
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:55,252
Speak.

951
01:13:57,197 --> 01:13:59,186
I'm staying in your house.

952
01:13:59,317 --> 01:14:01,881
Serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium

953
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,390
and murdered your people.

954
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:05,978
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

955
01:14:10,798 --> 01:14:13,489
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

956
01:14:13,771 --> 01:14:16,233
Only reason I don't kill
you where you stand

957
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,416
is because I know who you are.

958
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:21,328
Now what do you want?

959
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:24,132
I want the throne.

960
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,190
Incredible.

961
01:14:29,652 --> 01:14:31,740
Ya'll sittin' up here comfortable.

962
01:14:32,537 --> 01:14:34,046
Must feel good.

963
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,634
There's about two billion
people all over the world

964
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,380
that looks like us.

965
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:40,429
But their lives
are a lot harder.

966
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:42,760
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate them all.

967
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:45,666
And what tools are those?

968
01:14:45,836 --> 01:14:47,176
Vibranium.

969
01:14:47,764 --> 01:14:48,733
Your weapons.

970
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:52,360
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

971
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:56,310
It is not our way to be
judge, jury and executioner

972
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,582
for people who are not our own.

973
01:14:58,805 --> 01:15:00,219
Not you own?

974
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,859
But didn't life start right here
on this continent?

975
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,423
So ain't all people your people?

976
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:08,551
I am not king of all people.
I am King of Wakanda.

977
01:15:09,054 --> 01:15:10,914
And it is my responsibility

978
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,201
to make sure
our people are safe

979
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:14,685
and that the vibranium

980
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:17,345
does not fall into the hands
of a person like you.

981
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:18,514
-Hmm.
-Son.

982
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:21,072
We have entertained this
charlatan for too long.

983
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,408
Reject his request.

984
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,783
Oh, I ain't requestin' nothin'.

985
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:28,773
-Ask who I am
-You are Erik Stevens.

986
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:31,666
An American black operative.

987
01:15:31,743 --> 01:15:34,635
A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.

988
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:36,578
That's not my name, princess.

989
01:15:36,684 --> 01:15:38,043
Ask me, King.

990
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:39,239
No.

991
01:15:40,377 --> 01:15:41,648
Ask me.

992
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:45,333
Take him away.

993
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:47,845
Who are you?

994
01:15:47,912 --> 01:15:49,992
I am N'Jadaka.

995
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,692
Son of Prince N'Jobu.

996
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,286
Son of N'Jobu?

997
01:15:54,356 --> 01:15:56,706
I found my daddy with
panther claws in his chest!

998
01:15:56,784 --> 01:15:58,865
You ain't the son of a king.
You're the son of a murderer.

999
01:15:58,967 --> 01:16:00,069
You're lying!

1000
01:16:00,184 --> 01:16:02,557
-Lies!
-I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1001
01:16:05,038 --> 01:16:06,038
What?

1002
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:09,662
The descendant of N'Jobu.

1003
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:11,265
Hey, Auntie.

1004
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:16,649
I'm exercising my blood right.

1005
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:18,753
To challenge for the
mantles of king!

1006
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:20,461
And Black Panther.

1007
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:26,377
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1008
01:16:26,463 --> 01:16:30,529
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.

1009
01:16:30,615 --> 01:16:32,028
He has no rights here!

1010
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,403
The challenge will
take weeks to prepare.

1011
01:16:34,514 --> 01:16:37,359
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1012
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:39,930
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1013
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:42,481
And somebody to get me
out of these chains.

1014
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:49,288
T'Challa, what do
you know of this?

1015
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,943
I accept your challenge.

1016
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:12,213
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1017
01:17:12,405 --> 01:17:14,722
He should have just come
to the first challenge

1018
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:16,628
and gotten it over with.

1019
01:17:22,363 --> 01:17:26,155
The King will now have the
strength of the Black Panther

1020
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,117
stripped away.

1021
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:00,792
Where is Agent Ross?

1022
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:04,105
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1023
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:10,123
This is your last chance.

1024
01:18:12,127 --> 01:18:13,895
Throw down your weapons,

1025
01:18:14,082 --> 01:18:16,824
and we can handle
this another way.

1026
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:27,974
I lived my entire life
waiting for this moment.

1027
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:31,787
I trained, I lied, I killed

1028
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:33,630
just to get here.

1029
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,029
I killed in America, Afghanistan,

1030
01:18:40,226 --> 01:18:41,386
Iraq.

1031
01:18:42,253 --> 01:18:43,332
I took life

1032
01:18:43,404 --> 01:18:45,889
from my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.

1033
01:18:48,434 --> 01:18:49,942
And all this death...

1034
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:53,368
just so I could kill you.

1035
01:19:01,085 --> 01:19:04,268
Let the challenge begin.

1036
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:43,967
Yield!

1037
01:20:05,525 --> 01:20:06,837
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1038
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,574
Come on, get up.

1039
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,970
Come here.

1040
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,771
This is for my father.

1041
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:38,137
Erik!

1042
01:20:38,997 --> 01:20:40,796
-Zuri, no.
-Stop!

1043
01:20:41,243 --> 01:20:42,396
-Zuri!
-Zuri, don't!

1044
01:20:42,564 --> 01:20:44,515
I am the cause
of your father's death.

1045
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:45,983
Not him.

1046
01:20:46,431 --> 01:20:47,884
Take me.

1047
01:20:49,154 --> 01:20:50,877
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1048
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:52,567
No!

1049
01:20:52,788 --> 01:20:55,059
No! No!

1050
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:56,345
No!

1051
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:58,872
Zuri, no!

1052
01:21:00,057 --> 01:21:00,935
No!

1053
01:21:01,213 --> 01:21:02,729
No! No!

1054
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,563
Zuri! Zuri!

1055
01:21:05,168 --> 01:21:07,194
No! No!

1056
01:21:10,002 --> 01:21:12,529
Is this your king? Huh?

1057
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,856
Is this your king?

1058
01:21:22,154 --> 01:21:25,608
The Black Panther, who's about
to lead you into the future!

1059
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:27,104
Come on, brother!

1060
01:21:27,475 --> 01:21:29,043
Is there nothing that can be done?

1061
01:21:31,328 --> 01:21:32,569
Him?

1062
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,951
He's supposed to protect you?

1063
01:21:46,806 --> 01:21:48,421
-No!
-No!

1064
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:57,543
No!

1065
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:03,298
No. I'm your king.

1066
01:22:03,462 --> 01:22:05,359
-No!
-We have to go now!

1067
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:07,377
Queen Mother, let's go!

1068
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:45,153
The Queen Mother and
Shuri, they are safe?

1069
01:22:45,224 --> 01:22:46,057
Yes.

1070
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:48,038
Thank you.

1071
01:22:48,354 --> 01:22:50,725
We should get to them immediately.

1072
01:22:51,118 --> 01:22:52,719
I cannot.

1073
01:22:52,778 --> 01:22:53,546
What?

1074
01:22:53,628 --> 01:22:55,082
Go, my heart is with you.

1075
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:58,320
We cannot turn over our nation

1076
01:22:58,368 --> 01:23:00,622
to a man who showed up
here only hours ago.

1077
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:01,813
He is of royal blood.

1078
01:23:01,842 --> 01:23:04,202
-He killed T'Challa!
-In ritual combat.

1079
01:23:04,338 --> 01:23:06,117
Does that really matter?

1080
01:23:08,854 --> 01:23:11,942
You are the greatest
warrior Wakanda has.

1081
01:23:12,122 --> 01:23:16,137
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1082
01:23:16,217 --> 01:23:17,519
Overthrow?

1083
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:19,256
Nakia!

1084
01:23:20,724 --> 01:23:24,250
I'm not a spy who can
come and go as they so choose.

1085
01:23:25,224 --> 01:23:27,421
I am loyal to that throne,

1086
01:23:27,485 --> 01:23:29,859
no matter who sits upon it.

1087
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:32,180
What are you loyal to?

1088
01:23:35,519 --> 01:23:36,967
I loved him.

1089
01:23:38,307 --> 01:23:40,560
I love my country, too.

1090
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:43,047
Then you serve your country.

1091
01:23:43,206 --> 01:23:46,262
No. I save my country.

1092
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,375
What's wrong?

1093
01:23:56,456 --> 01:23:58,081
The King is dead.

1094
01:23:59,298 --> 01:24:01,632
Come with me, unless
you want to join him.

1095
01:24:21,184 --> 01:24:22,685
First Baba.

1096
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:25,770
And now my brother.

1097
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,204
Mama, we didn't even
get to bury him.

1098
01:24:31,252 --> 01:24:32,658
Shh.

1099
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,863
-It's me.
-Nakia.

1100
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:41,673
Who is this man?

1101
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,121
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1102
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:45,975
Where is Okoye?

1103
01:24:46,064 --> 01:24:47,230
Okoye's not coming.

1104
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:50,036
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1105
01:24:55,886 --> 01:24:57,128
Wait here.

1106
01:25:00,935 --> 01:25:03,350
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1107
01:25:05,743 --> 01:25:08,005
Allow the heart-shaped herb

1108
01:25:08,078 --> 01:25:11,095
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther

1109
01:25:11,194 --> 01:25:14,106
and take you to Ancestral Plane.

1110
01:26:49,052 --> 01:26:51,958
What did I tell you about
going into my things?

1111
01:26:52,475 --> 01:26:53,467
Hm?

1112
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:01,573
What did you find?

1113
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:03,747
Your home.

1114
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,220
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1115
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:15,048
Yes. The sunsets there are
the most beautiful in the world.

1116
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:19,832
But I fear you still
may not be welcome.

1117
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:23,426
Why?

1118
01:27:25,725 --> 01:27:27,225
They will say you are lost.

1119
01:27:27,753 --> 01:27:29,319
But I'm right here.

1120
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,154
No tears for me?

1121
01:27:40,359 --> 01:27:41,930
Everybody dies.

1122
01:27:43,773 --> 01:27:45,458
It's just life around here.

1123
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:51,676
Well, look at what I've done.

1124
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,777
I should have taken
you back long ago.

1125
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:01,323
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1126
01:28:06,217 --> 01:28:08,769
Well, maybe your home is
the one that's lost.

1127
01:28:10,877 --> 01:28:13,158
That's why they can't find us.

1128
01:28:20,113 --> 01:28:22,851
Breathe! Breathe, my King, breathe.

1129
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:25,074
Breathe. Breathe.

1130
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:43,953
The heart-shaped herb did that?

1131
01:28:46,604 --> 01:28:48,045
-This is all of it?
-Yes.

1132
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:49,777
So when it comes
time for another king,

1133
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:51,301
we will be ready.

1134
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:53,242
Another king?

1135
01:28:55,158 --> 01:28:57,109
Yeah, go ahead and
burn all that.

1136
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,001
My King, we cannot do that.

1137
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:01,159
It is our tradition--

1138
01:29:03,699 --> 01:29:06,985
When I tell you to do something,
I mean that shit.

1139
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,127
Burn it all!

1140
01:30:01,448 --> 01:30:03,262
You know, where I'm from,

1141
01:30:03,581 --> 01:30:05,733
when black folks started revolutions,

1142
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,465
they never had the firepower

1143
01:30:07,947 --> 01:30:10,057
or resources to fight
their oppressors.

1144
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,389
Where was Wakanda?

1145
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,578
Hm?

1146
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,036
All of that ends today.

1147
01:30:20,389 --> 01:30:23,365
We got spies embedded in
every nation on Earth.

1148
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:25,087
Already in place.

1149
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,972
I know how colonizers think.

1150
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:29,574
So we're gonna use their
own strategy against them.

1151
01:30:30,381 --> 01:30:33,198
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our war dogs.

1152
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,993
They'll arm oppressed
people all over the world.

1153
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,859
So they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1154
01:30:38,985 --> 01:30:40,239
And their children.

1155
01:30:40,296 --> 01:30:42,400
And anyone else who
takes their side.

1156
01:30:42,742 --> 01:30:44,979
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1157
01:30:45,216 --> 01:30:46,770
We're warriors!

1158
01:30:47,061 --> 01:30:48,661
The world's gonna start over,

1159
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,662
and this time, we're on top.

1160
01:30:51,567 --> 01:30:55,088
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1161
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:58,444
Wakanda has survived for so long

1162
01:30:58,568 --> 01:31:02,197
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1163
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:05,328
Wakanda survived in the
past this way, yes.

1164
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:08,600
But the world is
changing, General.

1165
01:31:09,146 --> 01:31:12,122
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1166
01:31:12,353 --> 01:31:14,393
The outside world
is catching up.

1167
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,198
And soon it will
be the conquerors

1168
01:31:17,563 --> 01:31:19,000
or the conquered.

1169
01:31:20,863 --> 01:31:22,747
I'd rather be the former.

1170
01:31:24,872 --> 01:31:27,768
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1171
01:31:29,255 --> 01:31:30,587
So, where are we going again?

1172
01:31:30,698 --> 01:31:33,246
We are taking the heart-shaped
herb to Jabari land.

1173
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,082
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

1174
01:31:35,298 --> 01:31:37,823
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1175
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:40,541
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1176
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:42,358
Nakia.

1177
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,975
I don't like this.

1178
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:49,890
The herb belongs to us.

1179
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:53,902
We may be creating a bigger
monster with M'Baku.

1180
01:31:59,756 --> 01:32:01,479
Nakia,

1181
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:03,637
you should take it yourself.

1182
01:32:03,939 --> 01:32:07,543
I am a spy with no army.

1183
01:32:08,675 --> 01:32:10,563
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1184
01:32:12,301 --> 01:32:13,712
We'll go.

1185
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,488
Oh, boy.

1186
01:32:21,734 --> 01:32:23,497
Shh.

1187
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:28,176
Oh, shit.

1188
01:32:29,305 --> 01:32:31,117
Look down. Stay calm.

1189
01:32:31,432 --> 01:32:32,615
Shuri.

1190
01:32:33,722 --> 01:32:35,123
Look down.

1191
01:32:36,548 --> 01:32:37,390
Hi.

1192
01:33:10,432 --> 01:33:12,007
My son...

1193
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:16,573
was murdered in ritual combat.

1194
01:33:17,027 --> 01:33:19,067
-Were the odds fair?
-Yes, but--

1195
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,765
So it was less a
murder than a defeat.

1196
01:33:20,805 --> 01:33:22,194
Do not rub our noses in it!

1197
01:33:22,225 --> 01:33:23,503
Silence!

1198
01:33:24,028 --> 01:33:26,402
I make the pronouncements
here, girl.

1199
01:33:26,649 --> 01:33:30,341
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is...

1200
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:32,876
The new king...

1201
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:43,228
You cannot talk!

1202
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:47,136
One more word and I will
feed you to my children.

1203
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:53,957
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1204
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,087
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1205
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:09,987
This is why we are here.

1206
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:13,006
To offer this to you.

1207
01:34:13,253 --> 01:34:15,889
An outsider sits on our throne.

1208
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:18,360
Only you can help us stop him.

1209
01:34:35,766 --> 01:34:37,278
Come with me.

1210
01:34:54,136 --> 01:34:55,521
Impossible!

1211
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,228
Is he breathing?

1212
01:35:02,268 --> 01:35:05,136
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1213
01:35:05,358 --> 01:35:09,068
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge of the river border.

1214
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:10,400
He brought him to me.

1215
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:11,992
Why do you have him in the snow?

1216
01:35:12,038 --> 01:35:14,865
It is the only thing keeping him
from joining the ancestors.

1217
01:35:14,912 --> 01:35:17,404
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1218
01:35:17,488 --> 01:35:19,690
Take him, he'll be
dead in seconds.

1219
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:23,011
Nakia, the herb.

1220
01:35:39,644 --> 01:35:41,735
I call upon the ancestors.

1221
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,828
I call upon Bast.

1222
01:35:44,341 --> 01:35:47,314
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1223
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:49,948
Heal him.

1224
01:36:01,546 --> 01:36:04,487
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1225
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:05,962
Okay.

1226
01:36:18,034 --> 01:36:19,280
Glory to the ancestors.

1227
01:36:19,454 --> 01:36:20,631
Glory to the ancestors.

1228
01:36:21,472 --> 01:36:22,967
Glory to the ancestors.

1229
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,456
Glory to the ancestors.

1230
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:28,332
Wake up, T'Challa.

1231
01:36:29,412 --> 01:36:30,796
Wake up.

1232
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:34,356
My son.

1233
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:42,077
The time has come

1234
01:36:42,203 --> 01:36:43,926
for you to come home

1235
01:36:44,063 --> 01:36:46,418
and be reunited with me.

1236
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:58,680
Why?

1237
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:03,775
Why didn't you bring
the boy home?

1238
01:37:05,804 --> 01:37:07,104
Why, Baba?

1239
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:10,027
He...

1240
01:37:11,163 --> 01:37:14,341
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1241
01:37:15,561 --> 01:37:18,149
You were wrong to abandon him.

1242
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,600
I chose my people.

1243
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,381
I chose Wakanda.

1244
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:25,796
Our future depended

1245
01:37:25,876 --> 01:37:27,306
You were wrong!

1246
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:29,721
All of you were wrong!

1247
01:37:30,755 --> 01:37:33,731
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1248
01:37:35,738 --> 01:37:38,319
We let the fear of discovery

1249
01:37:38,398 --> 01:37:40,826
stop us from doing
what is right.

1250
01:37:41,784 --> 01:37:43,039
No more!

1251
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:50,768
I cannot stay here with you.

1252
01:37:52,484 --> 01:37:56,761
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1253
01:37:57,235 --> 01:38:00,515
He is a monster
of our own making.

1254
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:05,506
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1255
01:38:07,386 --> 01:38:09,994
I must right these wrongs.

1256
01:38:20,831 --> 01:38:22,943
Do you have a blanket?

1257
01:38:25,304 --> 01:38:28,310
Killmonger has the full
support of our military.

1258
01:38:28,451 --> 01:38:29,983
And...

1259
01:38:30,587 --> 01:38:33,347
He burned the garden
of the heart-shaped herb.

1260
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:36,396
Of course he did. That's
what he was trained to do.

1261
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:40,655
His unit used to work with the CIA
to destabilize foreign countries.

1262
01:38:40,774 --> 01:38:42,832
They would always strike
at transitions of power,

1263
01:38:42,921 --> 01:38:45,159
like an election year,
or a death of a monarch.

1264
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,697
He got control of
government, the military...

1265
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:49,828
-Our resources.
-Right.

1266
01:38:50,975 --> 01:38:52,074
The Great Mound.

1267
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:54,091
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1268
01:38:54,155 --> 01:38:56,707
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1269
01:38:59,965 --> 01:39:02,180
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1270
01:39:02,243 --> 01:39:04,006
-What?
-What about you?

1271
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:06,412
The challenge
will have to continue.

1272
01:39:06,536 --> 01:39:09,869
T'Challa, we will
not leave Wakanda.

1273
01:39:09,957 --> 01:39:11,921
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1274
01:39:12,109 --> 01:39:14,661
If he gets control
of our technology,

1275
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:16,662
nowhere will be safe.

1276
01:39:36,748 --> 01:39:38,668
The Black Panther lives.

1277
01:39:39,418 --> 01:39:41,476
And when fights for
the fate of Wakanda,

1278
01:39:41,557 --> 01:39:44,417
I will be right there beside him.

1279
01:39:45,461 --> 01:39:46,829
As will I.

1280
01:39:47,203 --> 01:39:48,588
I'm in too.

1281
01:39:49,925 --> 01:39:52,457
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1282
01:39:55,514 --> 01:39:56,979
Are you're done?

1283
01:39:58,113 --> 01:40:00,597
A-Are you-are you-
are you done?

1284
01:40:01,657 --> 01:40:05,108
Could you give me and
Lord M'Baku a moment?

1285
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:14,600
Thank you.

1286
01:40:15,065 --> 01:40:17,359
I owed you a great debt.

1287
01:40:18,213 --> 01:40:19,828
A life for a life.

1288
01:40:19,948 --> 01:40:21,400
Consider it paid.

1289
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:24,536
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1290
01:40:25,113 --> 01:40:28,054
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1291
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:31,828
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1292
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,731
I bet you could.

1293
01:40:34,449 --> 01:40:35,979
But no.

1294
01:40:37,612 --> 01:40:40,382
I will give no Jabari
lives towards your cause.

1295
01:40:40,465 --> 01:40:42,186
It is <i>our</i> cause.

1296
01:40:42,557 --> 01:40:44,905
-It's for all of us.
-Us?

1297
01:40:45,104 --> 01:40:48,908
Us? You are the first king to
come here in centuries, and now

1298
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:52,152
you speak of "us"?

1299
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,527
I cannot speak for past kings.

1300
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:58,983
But an enemy sits on
the throne right now.

1301
01:40:59,284 --> 01:41:02,131
We both know
the power of vibranium.

1302
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:04,923
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1303
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:06,931
who do you think
he will come for next?

1304
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:18,219
We will not help you.

1305
01:41:46,485 --> 01:41:47,826
Everything is on schedule.

1306
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:49,095
Have the spies been alerted?

1307
01:41:49,192 --> 01:41:51,564
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1308
01:41:51,715 --> 01:41:54,310
But the war dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong

1309
01:41:54,335 --> 01:41:55,869
are standing by.

1310
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:58,304
We'll strike there first.

1311
01:41:58,375 --> 01:42:00,088
The others will come around.

1312
01:42:00,604 --> 01:42:01,677
Look at this.

1313
01:42:01,703 --> 01:42:04,497
A handheld sonic cannon
powerful enough to stop a tank.

1314
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:06,604
Untraceable by metal detectors.

1315
01:42:06,636 --> 01:42:08,867
And we got thousands of 'em.

1316
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:13,720
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1317
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:46,817
He lives!

1318
01:42:50,728 --> 01:42:52,595
N'Jadaka!

1319
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,956
What's up?

1320
01:42:55,157 --> 01:42:57,140
I never yielded!

1321
01:42:57,622 --> 01:43:01,297
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1322
01:43:01,868 --> 01:43:03,863
All that challenge
shit is over with.

1323
01:43:03,918 --> 01:43:05,237
I'm the king now.

1324
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:07,559
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1325
01:43:15,967 --> 01:43:17,693
-Shuri now.
-Copy that.

1326
01:43:20,729 --> 01:43:22,658
Go, go, go, go, go!

1327
01:43:22,752 --> 01:43:23,779
Come on, Ross.

1328
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,595
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1329
01:43:27,438 --> 01:43:30,972
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1330
01:43:34,578 --> 01:43:36,403
What will we do?

1331
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:38,345
Border Tribe!

1332
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,463
You!

1333
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,952
Your heart is so full of hatred.

1334
01:43:56,038 --> 01:43:57,944
You are not fit to be a king!

1335
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:03,381
Come on.

1336
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:04,847
Ayo, the King!

1337
01:44:06,087 --> 01:44:07,087
Come on!

1338
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:21,030
Shields!

1339
01:44:56,096 --> 01:44:57,595
W'Kabi, stop this!

1340
01:44:58,733 --> 01:45:00,122
Stop this now!

1341
01:45:04,396 --> 01:45:05,429
No!

1342
01:45:33,521 --> 01:45:36,323
Nakia and I will get control
the Royal Talon with this.

1343
01:45:36,481 --> 01:45:37,792
So, what do I do?

1344
01:45:38,202 --> 01:45:39,820
You'll have to fly it.

1345
01:45:40,122 --> 01:45:42,097
-What?
-You were a great pilot.

1346
01:45:42,185 --> 01:45:44,220
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1347
01:45:44,314 --> 01:45:46,546
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1348
01:45:46,853 --> 01:45:48,750
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1349
01:45:49,029 --> 01:45:50,838
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1350
01:45:50,966 --> 01:45:53,911
-I'm not a Dora.
-Just put it on, it's armor!

1351
01:45:55,376 --> 01:45:56,440
Come!

1352
01:45:58,644 --> 01:45:59,921
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1353
01:46:00,009 --> 01:46:01,761
-Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing
-We're counting on you.

1354
01:46:01,801 --> 01:46:02,983
with this.

1355
01:46:15,634 --> 01:46:16,890
Wakanda forever.

1356
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,981
Come on!

1357
01:46:36,497 --> 01:46:37,515
Go! Go!

1358
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:46,426
<i>Remote piloting system activated.</i>

1359
01:46:47,427 --> 01:46:48,445
Oh, my God.

1360
01:46:48,536 --> 01:46:51,548
I made it American style for you.
Get in.

1361
01:46:51,966 --> 01:46:53,354
All right.

1362
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,730
Yes!

1363
01:47:02,512 --> 01:47:03,219
Go!

1364
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,863
We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1365
01:47:07,152 --> 01:47:08,453
All right, I'm on it.

1366
01:47:25,404 --> 01:47:26,594
Shut!

1367
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,475
Down!

1368
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,751
Take the necklace!

1369
01:47:31,305 --> 01:47:32,761
Take the necklace!

1370
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,609
Wakanda forever!

1371
01:47:49,457 --> 01:47:51,942
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1372
01:47:52,029 --> 01:47:53,577
Shoot them down, genius!

1373
01:47:53,664 --> 01:47:54,823
Oh, right.

1374
01:47:55,806 --> 01:47:57,298
Here goes nothin'.

1375
01:48:04,471 --> 01:48:05,670
All right, got 'em.

1376
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:11,158
Oh, shit.

1377
01:48:11,907 --> 01:48:13,677
Shit!

1378
01:49:10,192 --> 01:49:11,193
Shuri!

1379
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,212
What's up, princess?

1380
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:19,367
You will never be a true king.

1381
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:23,265
Brother!

1382
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:56,555
Shuri.

1383
01:49:57,293 --> 01:49:58,293
Brother!

1384
01:49:58,988 --> 01:50:00,965
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1385
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:03,072
Stabilizers will
deactivate your suit!

1386
01:50:03,148 --> 01:50:04,543
You won't have protection!

1387
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:05,996
Neither will he.

1388
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:07,118
Okay!

1389
01:50:31,546 --> 01:50:33,444
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1390
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:35,043
Your reign is over!

1391
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:37,073
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1392
01:50:37,153 --> 01:50:40,543
You want to see us become just
like the people you hate so much.

1393
01:50:40,606 --> 01:50:42,377
Divide and conquer
the land it takes.

1394
01:50:42,457 --> 01:50:44,037
No, I've learned from my enemies.

1395
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:46,578
-Beat 'em at their own game.
-You have become them!

1396
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:49,065
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1397
01:50:49,161 --> 01:50:50,761
The world took
everything away from me!

1398
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,578
Everything I ever loved!

1399
01:50:52,698 --> 01:50:54,139
But I'ma make sure we're even.

1400
01:50:54,255 --> 01:50:57,480
I'ma track down anyone who would
even think of being loyal to you!

1401
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,934
And I'ma put their ass in the dirt,
right next to Zuri!

1402
01:51:01,935 --> 01:51:03,086
Nakia!

1403
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,363
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay, you?

1404
01:51:08,466 --> 01:51:09,287
Yes.

1405
01:51:09,384 --> 01:51:10,384
Let's go.

1406
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:19,729
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1407
01:51:22,378 --> 01:51:23,386
What the hell was that?

1408
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:24,773
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1409
01:51:24,846 --> 01:51:25,717
What? Where?

1410
01:51:25,828 --> 01:51:27,587
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1411
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:34,470
Ross, you have to get
out of there now!

1412
01:51:35,305 --> 01:51:36,582
How long have I got?

1413
01:51:37,409 --> 01:51:40,457
<i>Glass integrity is at 50 percent.</i>

1414
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:42,324
Put me back in.

1415
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,475
Ross!

1416
01:51:44,006 --> 01:51:44,997
Ross!

1417
01:52:03,079 --> 01:52:04,511
Surrender now!

1418
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:07,805
You have three seconds
to lay down their weapons!

1419
01:52:07,962 --> 01:52:08,927
One!

1420
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:10,730
Two!

1421
01:52:11,282 --> 01:52:12,154
Thr--

1422
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,500
Witness the might of the Jabari
firsthand!

1423
01:53:05,354 --> 01:53:08,626
<i>Glass integrity is at 15 percent.</i>

1424
01:53:16,725 --> 01:53:18,725
<i>-Critical weapons failure.</i>
-Shit!

1425
01:53:23,862 --> 01:53:26,770
Shuri, the last cargo ship
is almost at the border,

1426
01:53:26,863 --> 01:53:28,239
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1427
01:53:28,284 --> 01:53:29,796
Make an X with your arms!

1428
01:53:30,442 --> 01:53:32,530
<i>Sonic overload initiated.</i>

1429
01:53:33,756 --> 01:53:34,900
Now, break it.

1430
01:53:43,628 --> 01:53:45,653
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1431
01:53:45,913 --> 01:53:46,716
<i>Four...</i>

1432
01:53:46,876 --> 01:53:47,722
<i>Three...</i>

1433
01:53:47,969 --> 01:53:48,832
<i>Two...</i>

1434
01:53:49,046 --> 01:53:50,006
<i>One.</i>

1435
01:53:50,462 --> 01:53:51,576
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1436
01:54:03,765 --> 01:54:05,020
Yes! We did it!

1437
01:54:05,411 --> 01:54:07,617
Great! Now get out of there!

1438
01:54:18,091 --> 01:54:19,305
Attack!

1439
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:41,060
Drop your weapon.

1440
01:54:42,927 --> 01:54:45,221
Would you kill me, my love?

1441
01:54:45,386 --> 01:54:46,863
For Wakanda?

1442
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,872
Without question.

1443
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:37,543
This is it for you, cousin.

1444
01:56:03,069 --> 01:56:04,506
Hell of a move.

1445
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:29,481
Hell, pops said Wakanda was the
most beautiful he ever seen.

1446
01:56:32,734 --> 01:56:35,148
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1447
01:56:36,894 --> 01:56:38,448
Can you believe that?

1448
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:42,380
Kid from Oakland running around
believing in fairy tales.

1449
01:57:30,766 --> 01:57:32,488
It's beautiful.

1450
01:57:46,907 --> 01:57:49,105
Maybe we can still heal you.

1451
01:57:51,746 --> 01:57:52,921
Why?

1452
01:57:54,627 --> 01:57:56,805
So you can just lock me up?

1453
01:58:00,114 --> 01:58:01,359
Nah.

1454
01:58:03,307 --> 01:58:05,127
Just bury me in the ocean...

1455
01:58:05,541 --> 01:58:08,287
with my ancestors that
jumped from the ships.

1456
01:58:08,859 --> 01:58:12,930
'Cause they knew death
was better than bondage.

1457
01:59:36,822 --> 01:59:37,953
Thank you.

1458
01:59:39,773 --> 01:59:41,389
You saved me.

1459
01:59:42,113 --> 01:59:44,003
You saved my family.

1460
01:59:46,717 --> 01:59:47,865
Our nation.

1461
01:59:48,029 --> 01:59:50,261
There is nothing to thank me for.

1462
01:59:50,595 --> 01:59:52,039
It is our duty to...

1463
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:58,502
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1464
01:59:59,588 --> 02:00:00,654
I should have...

1465
02:00:07,442 --> 02:00:09,609
You can't blame me, I almost died.

1466
02:00:13,106 --> 02:00:14,279
Stay.

1467
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:20,306
I think I know a way you can
still fulfill your calling.

1468
02:00:21,502 --> 02:00:22,936
Please stay.

1469
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:57,505
Ooh, don't lose it!

1470
02:00:58,509 --> 02:00:59,608
Bucket!

1471
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:00,739
Easy.

1472
02:01:03,913 --> 02:01:07,011
When you said you would take me
to California for the first time,

1473
02:01:07,188 --> 02:01:09,097
I thought you meant Coachella

1474
02:01:09,314 --> 02:01:10,784
or Disneyland.

1475
02:01:11,432 --> 02:01:12,802
Why here?

1476
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:19,318
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1477
02:01:24,774 --> 02:01:26,534
They're tearing it down.

1478
02:01:27,612 --> 02:01:28,612
Good.

1479
02:01:28,782 --> 02:01:30,693
They are not tearing it down.

1480
02:01:31,998 --> 02:01:33,766
I bought this building.

1481
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:37,447
And that building.

1482
02:01:38,363 --> 02:01:40,069
And that one over there.

1483
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:45,529
This will be the first Wakanda
International Outreach Center.

1484
02:01:46,363 --> 02:01:49,189
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1485
02:01:49,954 --> 02:01:53,573
And you will spearhead the Science
and Information Exchange.

1486
02:01:54,929 --> 02:01:57,300
-You're kidding.
-Yeah?

1487
02:02:06,658 --> 02:02:08,895
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

1488
02:02:09,618 --> 02:02:11,078
Man, what the hell is that?

1489
02:02:11,135 --> 02:02:12,828
It's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1490
02:02:12,876 --> 02:02:15,248
It came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1491
02:02:18,524 --> 02:02:19,634
What?

1492
02:02:21,752 --> 02:02:22,752
Check this out, bro.

1493
02:02:22,841 --> 02:02:24,715
Take this back to the house, yo.

1494
02:02:25,257 --> 02:02:26,717
Pull up to school in this.

1495
02:02:26,742 --> 02:02:28,632
Hey, look, we can break it apart,
we can sell it.

1496
02:02:28,735 --> 02:02:30,546
-On eBay.
-I could get a million a piece.

1497
02:02:30,617 --> 02:02:32,063
Ah, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you guys.

1498
02:02:32,103 --> 02:02:33,483
-Where you come from?
-From Wakanda.

1499
02:02:33,568 --> 02:02:34,770
What is a Wakanda?

1500
02:02:34,939 --> 02:02:35,939
Hey, yo!

1501
02:02:36,363 --> 02:02:37,554
This yours?

1502
02:02:41,212 --> 02:02:42,212
Who...

1503
02:02:43,162 --> 02:02:44,398
Who are you?

1504
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:52,458
♪ This may be the night that
my dreams might let me know ♪

1505
02:02:52,608 --> 02:02:54,640
♪ All the stars are closer ♪

1506
02:02:54,934 --> 02:02:57,529
♪ All the stars are closer ♪

1507
02:02:57,881 --> 02:02:59,873
United Nations, Vienna, Austria

1508
02:03:09,563 --> 02:03:11,664
My name is King T'Challa.

1509
02:03:11,969 --> 02:03:13,948
Son of King T'Chaka.

1510
02:03:14,265 --> 02:03:18,356
I am the sovereign ruler
of the Nation of Wakanda.

1511
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:21,479
And for the first
time in our history,

1512
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:25,096
we will be sharing our
knowledge and resources

1513
02:03:25,194 --> 02:03:26,989
with the outside world.

1514
02:03:27,079 --> 02:03:30,490
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1515
02:03:30,761 --> 02:03:32,201
We cannot.

1516
02:03:33,078 --> 02:03:34,462
We must not.

1517
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:37,113
We will work to be an example

1518
02:03:37,145 --> 02:03:40,201
of how we as brothers and
sisters on this Earth

1519
02:03:40,256 --> 02:03:42,261
should treat each other.

1520
02:03:42,404 --> 02:03:44,788
Now more than ever...

1521
02:03:45,436 --> 02:03:49,984
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1522
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:52,182
We all know the truth.

1523
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:55,747
More connects us
than separates us.

1524
02:03:55,932 --> 02:03:57,668
But in times of crisis.

1525
02:03:57,764 --> 02:04:00,270
the wise build bridges

1526
02:04:00,355 --> 02:04:03,097
while foolish build barriers.

1527
02:04:03,547 --> 02:04:05,492
We must find a way

1528
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:08,212
to look after one another

1529
02:04:08,311 --> 02:04:12,810
as if we were one single tribe.

1530
02:04:12,914 --> 02:04:14,985
With all due respect,
King T'Challa,

1531
02:04:15,056 --> 02:04:18,391
what can a nation of farmers have
to offer the rest of the world?

1532
02:04:25,436 --> 02:04:27,302
